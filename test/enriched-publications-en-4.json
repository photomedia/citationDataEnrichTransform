The chart was based on a similar visualization, developed by the first author, that displayed trends in music listening. This paper describes the design decisions and algorithms behind these graphics, and discusses the reaction on the Web. We suggest that this type of complex layered graph is effective for displaying large data sets to a mass audience. We provide a mathematical analysis of how this layered graph relates to traditional stacked graphs and to techniques such as ThemeRiver, showing how each method is optimizing a different ldquoenergy functionrdquo. Finally, we discuss techniques for coloring and ordering the layers of such graphs. Throughout the paper, we emphasize the interplay between considerations of aesthetics and legibility.", "AuthorNames-Deduped": "Lee Byron;Martin Wattenberg", "AuthorNames": "Lee Byron;Martin Wattenberg", "AuthorAffiliation": "The New York Times;Visual Communication Lab at IBM", "InternalReferences": "10.1109/TVCG.2006.163;10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532122;10.1109/TVCG.2007.70577;10.1109/INFVIS.2000.885098", "AuthorKeywords": "Streamgraph, ThemeRiver, listening history, lastfm, aesthetics, communication-minded visualization, time series", "AminerCitationCount_04-2020": "240", "XploreCitationCount - 2021-02": "179", "PubsCited": "20", "Award": "HM", "concepts": [{"label": "Last.fm", "language": "en", "dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Last.fm", "wikidataURI": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q183718"}, {"label": "New York City", "language": "en", "dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City", "wikidataURI": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7013127|http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60"}]}, {"Conference": "VAST", "Year": "2016", "Title": "C2A: Crowd consensus analytics for virtual colonoscopy", "DOI": "10.1109/VAST.2016.7883508", "Link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2016.7883508", "FirstPage": "21", "LastPage": "30", "PaperType": "C", "Abstract": "We present a medical crowdsourcing visual analytics platform called C<sup>2</sup>A to visualize, classify and filter crowdsourced clinical data. More specifically, C<sup>2</sup>A is used to build consensus on a clinical diagnosis by visualizing crowd responses and filtering out anomalous activity. Crowdsourcing medical applications have recently shown promise where the non-expert users (the crowd) were able to achieve accuracy similar to the medical experts. This has the potential to reduce interpretation/reading time and possibly improve accuracy by building a consensus on the findings beforehand and letting the medical experts make the final diagnosis. In this paper, we focus on a virtual colonoscopy (VC) application with the clinical technicians as our target users, and the radiologists acting as consultants and classifying segments as benign or malignant. In particular, C<sup>2</sup>A is used to analyze and explore crowd responses on video segments, created from fly-throughs in the virtual colon. C<sup>2</sup>A provides several interactive visualization components to build crowd consensus on video segments, to detect anomalies in the crowd data and in the VC video segments, and finally, to improve the non-expert user's work quality and performance by A/B testing for the optimal crowdsourcing platform and application-specific parameters. Case studies and domain experts feedback demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving workers' output quality, the potential to reduce the radiologists' interpretation time, and hence, the potential to improve the traditional clinical workflow by marking the majority of the video segments as benign based on the crowd consensus.", "AuthorNames-Deduped": "Ji Hwan Park;Saad Nadeem;Seyedkoosha Mirhosseini;Arie E.

Everyday, millions of messages are created, commented, and shared by people on social media websites, such as Twitter and Facebook. This provides valuable data for researchers and practitioners in many application domains, such as marketing, to inform decision-making. Distilling valuable social signals from the huge crowd's messages, however, is challenging, due to the heterogeneous and dynamic crowd behaviors. The challenge is rooted in data analysts' capability of discerning the anomalous information behaviors, such as the spreading of rumors or misinformation, from the rest that are more conventional patterns, such as popular topics and newsworthy events, in a timely fashion. FluxFlow incorporates advanced machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies, and offers a set of novel visualization designs for presenting the detected threads for deeper analysis. We evaluated FluxFlow with real datasets containing the Twitter feeds captured during significant events such as Hurricane Sandy. Through quantitative measurements of the algorithmic performance and qualitative interviews with domain experts, the results show that the back-end anomaly detection model is effective in identifying anomalous retweeting threads, and its front-end interactive visualizations are intuitive and useful for analysts to discover insights in data and comprehend the underlying analytical model.", "AuthorNames-Deduped": "Jian Zhao 0010;Nan Cao;Zhen Wen;Yale Song;Yu-Ru Lin;Christopher Collins 0001", "AuthorNames": "Jian Zhao;Nan Cao;Zhen Wen;Yale Song;Yu-Ru Lin;Christopher Collins", "AuthorAffiliation": "University of Toronto;MIT;MIT;IBM J.
