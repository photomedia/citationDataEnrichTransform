        "Abstract": "<bold>Objective: </bold>We sought to support public health surveillance and response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through rapid development and implementation of novel visualization applications for data amalgamated across sectors.<bold>Materials and Methods: </bold>We developed and implemented population-level dashboards that collate information on individuals tested for and infected with COVID-19, in partnership with state and local public health agencies as well as health systems. The dashboards are deployed on top of a statewide health information exchange. One dashboard enables authorized users working in public health agencies to surveil populations in detail, and a public version provides higher-level situational awareness to inform ongoing pandemic response efforts in communities.<bold>Results: </bold>Both dashboards have proved useful informatics resources. For example, the private dashboard enabled detection of a local community outbreak associated with a meat packing plant. The public dashboard provides recent trend analysis to track disease spread and community-level hospitalizations. Combined, the tools were utilized 133\u00a0637 times by 74\u00a0317 distinct users between June 21 and August 22, 2020. The tools are frequently cited by journalists and featured on social media.<bold>Discussion: </bold>Capitalizing on a statewide health information exchange, in partnership with health system and public health leaders, Regenstrief biomedical informatics experts rapidly developed and deployed informatics tools to support surveillance and response to COVID-19.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The application of public health informatics methods and tools in Indiana holds promise for other states and nations. Yet, development of infrastructure and partnerships will require effort and investment after the current pandemic in preparation for the next public health emergency.",

Thirty library websites from the top 100 universities listed in the QS World University Rankings 2021 were selected for this study. The university library websites were examined and were visited many times for gathering data. The results obtained showed that DVS can be divided into five aspects: information, services, training, tools and software, and information resources. Most libraries (93.3%) offered data visualization tools and software such as Tableau, R, Excel, Gephi, and Plotly. Twenty-six libraries (86.67%) provided information resources related to data visualization such as textbooks, data sources, external links to e-resources, and blogs. Moreover, 80% of the libraries offered DVS to the university community through their webpages. The findings of this study can help academic libraries improve DVS and draw the attention of libraries worldwide toward providing DVS in the future.",

Design/methodology/approach: This study carried out a bibliometric-oriented review on studies on higher education students' retention; 1,962 records were downloaded from Scopus and grouped into three five-year intervals: 2002\u20132006 (n = 236), 2007\u20132011 (n = 584) and 2012\u20132016 (n = 1,142). Centrality measures and text-mining techniques were used to analyse data. Findings: Clusters of academic networks were identified by using co-citation analysis. Also, terms with high semantic value were ranked and grouped by using automatic term extraction and co-word analysis. Practical implications: The bibliometric approach used in this study identifies clusters of authors specialized in student retention, as well as detects the primary terms within this research field. Originality/value: This paper provides evidence that a bibliometric approach in conjunction with data visualization can be a valuable complement to in-depth literature reviews for the decision-making process.",

This paper synthesizes information on eight institutions' experiences in offering Excel-focused data visualization workshops with the goal of providing an overview of the current state of educational offerings in this area. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted by phone and email with librarians at institutions that offer Excel-focused workshops, which were identified by reviewing the websites of Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries members and the 2019 Medical Library Association annual meeting program. Results: Librarians from six institutions were interviewed, online class materials from one institution were reviewed, and information from the author's institution was included, resulting in a total of eight institutions. Educational offerings in Excel-focused data visualization ranged from one workshop to five workshops in a series, which typically first presented information for beginners and then progressed to more advanced data visualization skills. Regarding motivations for offering these workshops, librarians stated that they were committed to providing instruction in software programs that were already familiar to users. Workshop evaluations, when available, were generally positive. Discussion: Because of its widespread availability and usage, Excel offers a compelling opportunity for providing hands-on data visualization instruction in health sciences libraries.",

The visualization of information is important as it makes the appropriate acquisition of the information through the visualization possible. The choice of the most appropriate information visualization method before commencing with the resolution of a given visual problem is primordial to obtaining an efficient solution. The objective of this paper is to describe an information visualization classification approach based on Treemap, which is able to identify the best information visualization model for a given problem. This is understood through the construction of an adequate information visualization meta-model. Firstly, the actual state of the visualization field is described, and then the rules and criteria used in this research are shown, with the aim of presenting a meta-model proposal based on Treemap visualization methods. Besides this, the authors present a case study with the information contained in the Periodic Table visualization meta-model along with an analysis of the information search time complexity in each of the two meta-models. Finally, an evaluation of the results is presented through the experiments conducted with users and a comparative analysis of the methods based on Treemap and the Periodic Table.",

        "Abstract": "This case report applied principles from the data visualization (DV) literature and feedback from nurses to develop an effective report to display adherence with an evidence-based fall prevention program. We tested the usability of the original and revised reports using a Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale (Health-ITUES) customized for this project. Items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale, strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). The literature emphasized that the ideal display maximizes the information communicated, minimizes the cognitive efforts involved with interpretation, and selects the correct type of display (eg, bar versus line graph). Semi-structured nurse interviews emphasized the value of simplified reports and meaningful data. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) Health-ITUES score for the original report was 3.86 (0.19) and increased to 4.29 (0.11) in the revised report (Mann Whitney U Test, z = -12.25, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Lessons learned from this study can inform report development for clinicians in implementation science.",

        "Abstract": "Information visualization and data visualization are often viewed as similar, but distinct domains, and they have drawn an increasingly broad range of interest from diverse sectors of academia and industry. This study systematically analyzes and compares the intellectual landscapes of the two domains between 2000 and 2014. The present study is based on bibliographic records retrieved from the Web of Science. Using a topic search and a citation expansion, we collected two sets of data in each domain. Then, we identified emerging trends and recent developments in information visualization and data visualization, captivated in intellectual landscapes, landmark articles, bursting keywords, and citation trends of the domains. We found out that both domains have computer engineering and applications as their shared grounds. Our study reveals that information visualization and data visualization have scrutinized algorithmic concepts underlying the domains in their early years. Successive literature citing the datasets focuses on applying information and data visualization techniques to biomedical research. Recent thematic trends in the fields reflect that they are also diverging from each other. In data visualization, emerging topics and new developments cover dimensionality reduction and applications of visual techniques to genomics. Information visualization research is scrutinizing cognitive and theoretical aspects. In conclusion, information visualization and data visualization have co-evolved. At the same time, both fields are distinctively developing with their own scientific interests.",

Thus, it would be compelling to analyze the coverage of online information sources related to biological, chemical, and nutritional food risks, and related safety issues, to understand the type of content that online readers are exposed to, possibly influencing their perceptions.<bold>Objective: </bold>The aim of this study was to identify the types of online sources that are predominantly covering this theme, and the topics that have received the most attention in terms of coverage and engagement on social media.<bold>Methods: </bold>We performed an analysis of big data related to food risks by combining web monitoring techniques, content analysis, and data visualization of a large amount of unstructured text. Using a dictionary-based approach, a web monitoring app was instructed to automatically collect web content referring to the food risk and safety field. Data were retrieved from March 2017 to February 2018. The validated corpus (N=12,163) was subject to automatic and manual content analysis. Results were combined with descriptive statistics extracted from Web-Live and processed with Qlik Sense.<bold>Results: </bold>Nutritional risks and news about outbreaks, controls, and alerts were the most widely covered topics. Thematic sources devoted major attention to nutritional topics, whereas national sources covered food risks, especially during food emergencies. Regarding engagement on social media, readers' interest was higher for nutritional topics and animal welfare. Although traditional sources still publish a great amount of content related to food risks and safety, new mediators have emerged as alternative sources for food risk information.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This mixed methodological approach was demonstrated to be a useful means for obtaining an accurate characterization of the online discourse on food risks, and can provide insight into how the monitored sources contribute to the process of risk communication.",

        "Abstract": "Information design practice strives for objectivity through clean and efficient transmittal of data. One might call this kind of information design 'virtuous.' However, in Peircean semiotic theory, any habitual, principled, structured, or recurrent use of a sign will become a symbol that must inevitably inhere toward alliance with some cultural genre. This sets up a tension between the aspiration for completely \"distanced\" objectivity and one's inevitable culturally-situated stance which seemingly cannot be excised. The present article examines this problem using the famous Charles Minard graph of Napoleon's Russian campaign, the stylistic marker of \"ratcheting\", and the employment of semiotic Semantic Profiles. The conclusion is that in any visual display of data, complete detachment is semiotically impossible; the question then is no longer how to eliminate all non-efficient or non-objective visual elements, but rather, which culturally-embedded choices are most relevant and ethical for a designer to make?",

        "Abstract": "Improving the quality of patient care, generally referred to as Quality Improvement (QI), is a constant mission of healthcare. Although QI initiatives take many forms, these typically involve collecting data to measure whether changes to procedures have been made as planned, and whether those changes have achieved the expected outcomes. In principle, such data are used to measure the success of a QI initiative and make further changes if needed. In practice, however, many QI data reports provide only limited insight into changes that could improve patient care. Redesigning standard approaches to QI data can help close the gap between current norms and the potential of QI data to improve patient care. This paper describes our study of QI data needs among healthcare providers and managers at Vancouver Coastal Health, a regional health system in Canada. We present an overview of challenges faced by healthcare providers around QI data collection and visualization, and illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of different visualizations. At present, user- centred and evidence-based design is practically unknown in healthcare QI, and thus offers an important new contribution.",

        "Abstract": "Motivation: Reviewing the adverse event data collected in clinical trials is a lengthy and tedious process when these data are presented in the form of tables, data listings, and static graphs. Thus, to enable anyone interested in exploring adverse event data efficiently and relatively independently, we developed AdEPro, a compact, powerful, and easy-to-use interactive app. Description and Use of the App: AdEPro is an app for (audio-)visualizing adverse event data from clinical trials. The app dynamically displays the onset, severity, and development of selected adverse events on the individual subject level and on the treatment group level. This paper illustrates that there are numerous questions related to adverse events that can be approached by means of AdEPro, e.g., questions about temporal aspects of adverse events, associations between adverse events, and the influence of subject characteristics. AdEPro provides quick first answers to such questions; however, it does not provide statistical proof. Essentially, it acts as a versatile \"hypothesis generator,\" helping the user to decide whether further analyses are indicated. No programming knowledge is required for exploring data by means of AdEPro. However, the user needs some basic knowledge of the software R and of extracting data from a clinical data base. The software code is open source, allowing modifications and expansions of the app, if desired. Availability and Implementation: AdEPro can be freely obtained from https://cran.r-project.org/package=adepro. It runs on any computer on which R is installed. Patient data are stored and processed locally.",

        "Abstract": "Objective: The primary objective of this study was to explore different dimensions of Journal of the Medical Library Association (JMLA) authorship from 2006-2017. Dimensions that were evaluated using coauthorship networks and affiliation data included collaboration, geographical reach, and relationship between Medical Library Association (MLA) member and nonmember authors. A secondary objective was to analyze the practice and practical application of data science skills. Methods: A team of librarians who attended the 2017 Data Science and Visualization Institute used JMLA bibliographic metadata extracted from Scopus, together with select MLA membership data from 2006-2017. Data cleaning, anonymization, analysis, and visualization were done collaboratively by the team members to meet their learning objectives and to produce insights about the nature of collaborative authorship at JMLA. Results: Sixty-nine percent of the 1,351 JMLA authors from 2006-2017 were not MLA members. MLA members were more productive and collaborative, and tended to author articles together. The majority of the authoring institutions in JMLA are based in the United States. Global reach outside of the United States and Canada shows higher authorship in English-speaking countries (e.g., Australia, United Kingdom), as well as in Western Europe and Japan. Conclusions: MLA support of JMLA may benefit a wider network of health information specialists and medical professionals than is reflected in MLA membership. Conducting coauthorship network analyses can create opportunities for health sciences librarians to practice applying emerging data science and data visualization skills.",

Additionally, our institution is home to many researchers with a strong interest in data visualization but who are generally working in isolation of one another. Case Presentation: This case study describes an innovative workshop, the \"Data Visualization Clinic,\" where members of our library's community bring in data visualization projects such as figures in papers, projects hosted online, and handouts and receive constructive feedback from a group of peers. The authors detail the process of hosting a clinic and the feedback that we received from participants. Conclusions: The \"Data Visualization Clinic\" offers a viable workshop to leverage expertise of library users and build the library's reputation as a hub of data visualization services without heavy investment in infrastructure like special monitors or coding skills. That said, it faces the challenge of relying on the participation of the broader community, which is often pressed for time. The event can also serve as an opportunity for researchers who have an interest in data visualization to meet and network.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose A Recent work in information studies re-engages with theories of subject enunciation first developed in the work of twentieth century structuralist and post-structuralist critics. To date this work has not been extended to the analysis of data visualizations. The purpose of this paper is to assert that information visualizations embody specific dynamics of positionality for which linguist Emile Benveniste\u2019s formulation of a speaking and spoken subject provides a critical analytic framework. In particular, enunciative theory can be used to explicitly address the mechanisms of power formation in information graphics \u201cspreadsheets, charts and interfaces\u201d that are frequently seen as mere presentations of quantitative or statistical information. This approach is based on attention to the performative aspects of graphic expression and the ways familiar features such as frontality framing and scale can be read critically.Design/methodology/approach A theoretical argument that applies literature in enunciation as developed in linguistics, film theory, and psychoanalysis to information visualizations. The paper makes specific analyses of the graphical features of spreadsheets, common charts and graphs, and interfaces to show how they create speaking and spoken subject positions.Findings The theory of enunciation is useful in understanding the ways information representations, particularly visualizations of data, work to produce power relations.Research limitations/implications The topic may seem to draw on theoretical positions that are associated with structural and post-structural theory popular three decades ago, but since the study of enunciation was never applied to information visualizations, the work feels timely. Recent work in information studies has re-engaged with these theoretical issues, but not applied them to charts, graphs, and other visual forms. Information visualizations are so prevalent that any critical insight into their operations feels timely, even urgent.Originality/value The concept of information as enunciation in recent work in information studies has not been applied to visualizations. Analysis of the production of subject positions as commonly understood in other fields (linguistics, textual studies, film studies, visual studies, and psychoanalysis across a broad range of cultural studies fields) can be usefully applied to information graphics.",

Depending on the system in place, this can result in the collection of large quantities of data, ripe for analysis. These data should include a wide variety of variables for each study because assessment of the propriety of the patient's dose is dependent on many factors, including patient age and size, as well as the body section that is being scanned. Moreover, the scanners themselves have many properties that affect patient dose, such as model, pitch and kVp. In this paper, we propose an engine that seamlessly integrated with a clinical PACS to retrieve radiation dosage data. We devised several schemes to analyze these data through visualization and mining techniques that examine it at different scopes. We demonstrate the utility of such visual methods at examining large, noisy, and multi-dimensional data, which is embodied in the collected radiation data.",

This article describes a visualization project that uses the visual metaphor of tree rings to explore the contribution of immigrants to the country's population. Immigrants and native-born persons are represented and differentiated as cells in trees, with layered annual rings capturing patterns of population growth. These rings register, in their shape and color, certain environmental conditions. In order to mimic the natural process by which growth rings are formed, we devised a computational system that simulates the growth of trees as if cells were data-units. Dendrochronology involves dating certain events by analyzing patterns of growth in trees. Analogously, in our visualizations the rings can be counted and dated, showing the chronological evolution of the population. The dendrochronology theme is a poetic take on the data, yet it is also a functional and conceptual space that is used to construct language and rationales on that data. The tree-growth process not only inspires the appearance of the visualizations but also informs the rules of the computational system that creates them.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: Library Hi Tech is one of the most influential journals that publish leading research in library and information science (LIS). The present study aims to understand the scholarly communication in Library Hi Tech by profiling its historic footprint, emerging trends and knowledge diffusion. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 3,131 bibliographic records between 1995 and 2018 were collected from the Web of Science. Text mining, graph analysis and data visualization were used to analyze subject category assignment, domain-level citation trends, co-occurrence of keywords, keyword bursts, networks of document co-citation and landmark articles. Findings: Findings indicated that published research in the journal was largely influenced by the psychology, education and social domain as a unidisciplinary discipline. Knowledge of the journal has been disseminated into multiple domains such as LIS, computer science and education. Dominant thematic concentrations were also identified: (1) library services in academic libraries and related to digital libraries, (2) adoption of new information technologies and (3) information-seeking behavior in these contexts. Additionally, the journal has exhibited an increased research emphasis on mixed-method user-centered studies and investigations into libraries' use of new media. Originality/value: This study provides a promising approach to understand scientific trends and the intellectual growth of journals. It also helps Library Hi Tech to become more self-explanatory with a detailed bibliometric profile and to identify future directions in editorship and readership. Finally, researchers in the community can better position their studies within the emerging trends and current challenges of the journal.",

        "Abstract": "Working with data is an increasingly powerful way of making knowledge claims about the world. There is, however, a growing gap between those who can work effectively with data and those who cannot. Because it is state and corporate actors who possess the resources to collect, store and analyze data, individuals (e.g., citizens, community members, professionals) are more likely to be the subjects of data than to use data for civic purposes. There is a strong case to be made for cultivating data literacy for people in non-technical fields as one way of bridging this gap. Literacy, following the model of popular education proposed by Paulo Freire, requires not only the acquisition of technical skills but also the emancipation achieved through the literacy process. This article proposes the term creative data literacy to refer to the fact that non-technical learners may need pathways towards data which do not come from technical fields. Here I offer five tactics to cultivate creative data literacy for empowerment. They are grounded in my experience as a data literacy researcher, educator and software developer. Each tactic is explained and introduced with examples. I assert that working towards creative data literacy is not only the work of educators but also of data creators, data publishers, tool developers, tool and visualization designers, tutorial authors, government, community organizers and artists.",

In this paper, we present our work for enabling efficient query processing on large raw data files for interactive visual exploration scenarios and analytics. We introduce a framework, named RawVis, built on top of a lightweight in-memory tile-based index, VALINOR, that is constructed on-the-fly given the first user query over a raw file and progressively adapted based on the user interaction. We evaluate the performance of a prototype implementation compared to three other alternatives and show that our method outperforms in terms of response time, disk accesses and memory consumption.

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION Since the 2000s, interest in research data management (RDM) has grown considerably. As a result, a large body of literature has discussed a broad variety of aspects related to data management. But, few studies have examined and also interpreted from visual perception the intellectual structure and progressive development of the existing literature on RDM. METHODS Guided by five research questions, this study employed bibliometric techniques and a visualization tool (CiteSpace) to identify and analyze the patterns of the scholarly publications about RDM. RESULTS Through CiteSpace's modeling and computing, the knowledge (or network) structures, significant studies, notable topics, and development trends in the literature of RDM were revealed. DISCUSSION The majority of the literature pertinent to RDM was published after 2002. Major research clusters within this interdisciplinary field include \"scientific collaboration,\" \"research support service,\" and \"data literacy,\" while the \"scientific collaboration\" research cluster was the most active. Topics such as \"digital curation\" and \"information processing\" appeared most frequently in the RDM literature. Additionally, there was a sharp increase in several specific topics, such as \"digital library,\" \"big data,\" and \"data sharing.\" CONCLUSION By looking into the \"profile\" of the literature on RDM, in terms of knowledge structure, evolving trends, and important topics in the domain, this work will add new information to current discussions about RDM, new service development, and future research focuses in this area.",

The approval of four gene therapy products since 2017 represents a significant milestone for a new class of treatments with the potential to treat or cure diseases, particularly rare diseases, that were previously considered incurable. Several factors have contributed to the recent rapid development of gene therapies including advances in genetics to facilitate target-detection, advances in vectors, and regulatory incentives such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and market exclusivity. The patient population affected by a rare disease is typically small, heterogeneous and geographically dispersed. As a result, clinical trials on a rare disease have unique features in terms of study design, subject enrollment, data analyses and interpretation of study results. Given that the patient population affected is small for rare diseases, providing substantial evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety in trials for rare disease presents challenges. In this paper, we share our experiences in the statistical review of three gene therapy products that have been approved by FDA CBER. Our motivation in writing this paper is to encourage the use of appropriate analysis strategies for other similar small trials, with a focus on data visualization strategies.",

        "Abstract": "In clinical studies there are huge numbers of laboratory parameters available that are measured at several visits for several treatment groups. The status quo for presenting laboratory data in clinical trials consists in generating large numbers of tables and data listings. Such tables and listings are required for submissions to health authorities. However, reviewing laboratory data presented in the form of tables and listings is a lengthy and tedious process. Thus, to enable efficient exploration of laboratory data we developed elaborator, a comprehensive and easy-to-use interactive browser-based application. The elaborator app comprises three analyses types for addressing different questions, for example about changes in laboratory values that frequently occur, treatment-related changes and changes beyond the normal ranges. In this way, the app can be used by study teams for identifying safety signals in a clinical trial as well as for generating hypotheses that are further inspected with detailed analyses and possibly data from other sources. The elaborator app is implemented in the statistical software R. The R package elaborator can be obtained from https://cran.r-project.org/package=elaborator. Patients' laboratory data need to be extracted from the clinical database and pre-processed locally for feeding into the app. For exploring data by means of the elaborator, the user needs some familiarity with R but no programming knowledge is required.",

        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Purpose: Libraries throughout the world use OCLC's EZproxy software to manage access to e-resources. When cleaned, processed, visualized and enhanced, these logs paint a valuable picture of a library's impact on researcher's lives. The purpose of this paper is to share techniques and procedures for enhancing and de-identifying EZproxy logs using Tableau, a data analytics and visualization software, and Tableau Prep, a tool used for cleaning, combining and shaping data for analysis. Design/methodology/approach: In February 2018, The Ohio State University Libraries established an automated daily process to extract and clean EZproxy log files. The assessment librarian created a series of procedures in Tableau and Tableau Prep to union, parse and enhance these files by adding information such as user major, user status (faculty, graduate or undergraduate) and the title of the requested resource. She last stripped the data set of identifiers and applied best practices for maintaining confidentiality to visualize the data. Findings: The data set is currently 1.5m rows and growing. The visualizations may be filtered by date, user status and user department/major where applicable. Safeguards are in place to limit data presentation when filters might reveal a user's identity. Originality/value: Tableau used in concert with Tableau Prep allows an assessment librarian to clean and combine data from various sources. Once procedures for cleaning and combining data sources are established, the data driving visualizations can be set to refresh on a set schedule. This expedites the ability of librarians to derive actionable insights from EZproxy data and to share the library's positive impact on researcher's lives.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose ? The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel approach that automates the visualisation of both quantitative data (the network) and qualitative data (the content) within emails to aid the triage of evidence during a forensics investigation. Email remains a key source of evidence during a digital investigation, and a forensics examiner may be required to triage and analyse large email data sets for evidence. Current practice utilises tools and techniques that require a manual trawl through such data, which is a time-consuming process. Design/methodology/approach ? This paper applies the methodology to the Enron email corpus, and in particular one key suspect, to demonstrate the applicability of the approach. Resulting visualisations of network narratives are discussed to show how network narratives may be used to triage large evidence data sets. Findings ? Using the network narrative approach enables a forensics examiner to quickly identify relevant evidence within large email data sets. Within the case study presented in this paper, the results identify key witnesses, other actors of interest to the investigation and potential sources of further evidence. Practical implications ? The implications are for digital forensics examiners or for security investigations that involve email data. The approach posited in this paper demonstrates the triage and visualisation of email network narratives to aid an investigation and identify potential sources of electronic evidence. Originality/value ? There are a number of network visualisation applications in use. However, none of these enable the combined visualisation of quantitative and qualitative data to provide a view of what the actors are discussing and how this shapes the network in email data sets.",

The final aim is to offer repository owners a scientific basis to support their decisions when they have to choose an interface that can really help users to effectively locate and visualise resources over large digital collections. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 This HCI study is divided into two parts: perception and usability. The first one analysed three perceptual abilities required to use interfaces: attention, retention of information and understanding. The second one was run on an ad hoc generated collection including more than 40,000 European digital resources collected and classified according to a given branch of knowledge in the Art & Architecture Thesaurus. Findings \u2013 Although visual interfaces proved useful for certain tasks related to resource discovery and search, and despite the overall good general user opinion, the authors found it necessary to conduct another thorough study to know more about the target users and the amplitude of the collection, as well as to determine the ideal type of interface to implement. All these factors are important for increasing user acceptance and avoiding unnecessary implementation costs. Research limitations/implications \u2013 This research was run on a relatively small sample size of users from Spain and Latin America, which may not be representative of the general population. In similar studies previous knowledge about usability has been reported to introduce bias in the results, so the authors tried to avoid this when selecting the participants. Originality/value \u2013 There are no previous usability studies for the development and implementation of interfaces in digital learning or cultural repositories. The authors' experience highlights the importance of addressing usability aspects a priori, to prevent users from ceasing to use visual interfaces over time, because they do not perceive any benefit from using them.",

Design/methodology/approach: Curtin Library's EZproxy log file data from 2013 to 2017 is used to develop the data visualisation prototypes using Unity3D software. Findings: Two visualisation prototypes from the EZproxy data set are developed. The first, \"Global Visualisation of Curtin Research Activity\", uses a geographical map of the world as a platform to show where each research request comes from, the time each is made and the file size of the request. The second prototype, \"Database Usage Visualisation\", shows the use of the library's various subscription databases by staff and students daily, over a month in April 2017. Research limitations/implications: The paper has following limitations: working to a tight timeline of ten weeks; time taken to cleanse noise data; and requirements for storing and hosting the voluminous data sets. Practical implications: The prototypes provide visual evidence of the use of Curtin Library's digital resources at any time and from anywhere by its users, demonstrating the demand for the library's online service offerings. These prototype evidence-based data visualisations empower the library to communicate in a compelling and interesting way how its services and subscriptions support Curtin University's missions. Originality/value: The paper provides innovative approaches to create immersive 3D data visualisation prototypes to make sense of complex EZproxy data sets.",

Specifically, we determine the impact of visual design on the Graphical Abstract (GA), an overview figure that attracts potential readers and visually summarizes what a paper is about. We show that GAs designed in accordance with classic visual design principles significantly enhance readers' first impressions of a paper. Well-designed GAs make papers seem more interesting, more clearly written and more scientifically rigorous.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services keeps track of a variety of health care indicators across the country, resulting in a large geospatially multivariate data set. Current visualization tools for such data sets make it difficult to make multivariate comparisons and show the geographic distribution of the selected variables at the same time. Community Health Map is a web application that enables users to visualize health care data in multivariate space as well as geospatially. It is designed to aid exploration of this huge data repository and deliver deep insights for policy makers, journalists, consumer groups, and academic researchers. Users can visualize the geospatial distribution of a given variable on an interactive map, and compare two or more variables using charts and tables. By employing dynamic query filters, visualizations can be narrowed down to specific ranges and regions. Our presentation to policy makers and pilot usability evaluation suggest that the Community Health Map provides a comprehensible and powerful interface for policy makers to visualize health care quality, public health outcomes, and access to care in an effort to help them to make informed decisions about improving health care.",

There are currently no decision support systems to allow repositioning coordinators to take advantage of recent algorithmic advances in creating repositioning plans. Furthermore, no study has addressed how to visualize repositioning plans and liner shipping services in an accessible manner. Displaying information such as cargo flows and interactions between vessels is a complex task due to the overlap of container demands and long time scales. To this end, we propose a web-based decision support system designed specifically for liner shipping fleet repositioning that integrates an extended version of a state-of-the-art simulated annealing solution approach. Our system supports users in evaluating different strategic settings and scenarios, allowing liner carriers to save money through better fleet utilization and cargo throughput, as well as reduce their environmental impact by using less fuel.",

Determining the types of data that will be most impactful in telling a library's story is vital to an effective online data display. This research project reviewed the websites of 143 academic research libraries to determine if the libraries were publicly sharing general library data via a dashboard or other data display. For those libraries sharing data, information was recorded on the types of data shared, the types of data visualizations utilized, the age of the data presented, and whether multi-year trends were represented. The results showed that just under half of the academic research libraries in the study population had general library data displays on their websites. Most focused on traditional types of library data, such as collection size, reference and help desk interactions, instruction sessions, and circulation numbers for physically-held materials. Data visualizations were used infrequently.",

Although these measures represent valuable tools for analyzing researchers' outputs, they usually assume the co-authorship to be a proportional collaboration between the parts, missing out their relationships and the relative scientific influences. In this work, we propose the d- index, a novel measure that estimates the dependence degree between authors on their research environment along their entire scientific publication history. We also present a web application that implements these ideas and provides a number of visualization tools for analyzing and comparing scientific dependences among all the scientists in the DBLP bibliographic database. Finally, relying on this web environment, we present case and user studies that highlight both the validity and the reliability of the proposed evaluation measure.",

        "Abstract": "For high-dimensional datasets in which clusters are formed by both distance and density structures (DDS), many clustering algorithms fail to identify these clusters correctly. This is demonstrated for 32 clustering algorithms using a suite of datasets which deliberately pose complex DDS challenges for clustering. In order to improve the structure finding and clustering in high-dimensional DDS datasets, projection-based clustering (PBC) is introduced. The coexistence of projection and clustering allows to explore DDS through a topographic map. This enables to estimate, first, if any cluster tendency exists and, second, the estimation of the number of clusters. A comparison showed that PBC is always able to find the correct cluster structure, while the performance of the best of the 32 clustering algorithms varies depending on the dataset.",

However, a visualization is only a single translation of reality, just like any other media, representation devices, or modes of representation. If we wish to encourage thoughtful, informed, and literate consumption of data visualizations, it is crucial that we consider why they are often presented and interpreted as objective. We reflect theoretically on data visualization as a system of representation historically anchored in science, rationalism, and notions of objectivity. It establishes itself within a lineage of conventions for visual representations which extends from the Renaissance to the present and includes perspective drawing, photography, cinema and television, as well as computer graphics. By examining our tendency to see credibility in data visualizations and grounding that predisposition in a historical context, we hope to encourage more critical and nuanced production and interpretation of data visualizations in the public discourse.",

The situation is further complicated by the extremely data-intensive environment with clinical data presented in distributed, often stand-alone information systems. To access and interpret all data is a complex and time-consuming technical and cognitive challenge. We propose a holistic integrated visualization in the form of a patient overview to support physicians in decision making for use of antibiotics at intensive care units. Special emphasis is put on analysis of work processes to identify information needs, the development of a visualization tool based on an integrated data model, and usability testing of the tool in combination with an eye-tracking technology. The visualization tool was highly rated in terms of user performance and preferences, and the analysis of users' visual patterns showed that different types of data visualization may benefit specialist and resident intensive care physicians depending on the task to be performed. A highly interactive tool for integrated information visualization could potentially increase the understanding of a patient's infection status and ultimately enhance decision making for the use of antibiotics.",

This work fills a gap about the effect of the information display format, visual or nonvisual, upon the client's decision. In the context of data visualization and confirmation bias, this work provides needed research on computer aided information seeking in a decision-making, informing environment. Guided by the theories of confirmation bias and cognitive fit, we propose and test a model that investigates the impact of a-priori decision confidence on seeking more information and information usefulness. Findings indicate that both information presentation type and confirmation bias affect the decision process of the information seeker.

Mapping the curriculum is difficult enough in the context of a single educational program, however, representing and exploring curriculum topics across the 14 different educational institutions participating in this study presented formidable difficulties. This article explores the approach to curriculum mapping used by the research team and discusses the technologies and information science principles used to classify, map, and visualize curriculum content. It will explain how the researchers constructed a taxonomy of over 600 educational terms, describe how the taxonomy was used to index 402 curriculum documents in a relational database, and illustrate the creation of curriculum visualizations using the Tableau\u2122 data visualization software. The way in which findings from this part of the study will inform subsequent phases of the research will be discussed. The strengths and limitations of the methodology will be noted and opportunities to use the assets created by the project for future endeavors identified.",

        "Abstract": "Recent years have seen a huge increase in the digital data generated by companies, projects and individuals. This has led to significant challenges in visualizing and using large, diverse collections of digital information. Indeed the speed and accuracy with which these large datasets can be effectively mined for information that is relevant and valuable can have a significant effect on company performance. This research investigates the feasibility of using visual representations for the searching and browsing of large, complex, multimedia data sets. This paper introduces the SIZL ( Searching for Information in a Zoom Landscape ) system, which was developed to enable the authors to effectively test whether a 2.5D graphical representation of a multimedia data landscape produces quantifiable improvements in a user's ability to assess its contents. The usability of this visualization system was analyzed using experiments and a combination of quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. The paper presents these results and discusses potential industrial applications as well as future work that will improve the SIZL data visualization method.",

The dataset is a large and complex one; one of its distinguishing features is its bi-hierarchical structure, arising from the distribution of money through agencies to specific projects and the natural aggregation of awards based on location. To offer a comprehensive overview of the data, a visualization must incorporate both these hierarchies. We present TreeCovery, a tool that accomplishes this through the use of two coordinated treemaps. The tool includes a number of innovative features, including coordinated zooming and filtering and a proportional highlighting technique across the two trees. TreeCovery was designed to facilitate data exploration, and initial user studies suggest that it will be helpful in insight generation. RATB (Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board) has tested TreeCovery and is considering including the concept in their visual analytics.",

Our system has three distinguished characteristics: (1) modular structure and simple architecture which make it easy and feasible for users to add new functions and features to the system, (2) a new search concept and method based on the bounding box and on dynamically delineated watershed boundary from GIS (Geographic Information System), and (3) no requirement on having any knowledge about or installation of any other complicated software. The architecture of our integrated data management system is based on a metadata approach, which consists of four components including a metadata mechanism and a Java-based application engine. The metadata mechanism in conjunction with the Java-based application engine allows users to access and retrieve diverse data formats and structures from many heterogeneous hydrological data sources. The visualization component of the system makes it possible for users to view their queried data first before spending time retrieving them. The extensible and integrative characteristics of our system are illustrated by an example in which new and unique functions for data merging and GIS-based data querying are added to the system. Although the data sources and applications shown in this prototype system are related to the field of hydrology, the ideas, approaches, and system architecture are not domain-specific, and can be used/applied to other fields as well.",

The study shows diseases associated with CKD before and after CKD diagnosis in a time-evolutionary type visualization. Materials and Methods Our sample data came from a population of one million individuals randomly selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, 1998 to 2011. From this group, those patients diagnosed with CKD were included in the analysis. We selected 11 of the most common diseases associated with CKD before its diagnosis and followed them until their death or up to 2011. We used a Sankey-style diagram, which quantifies and visualizes the transition between pre- and post-CKD states with various lines and widths. The line represents groups and the width of a line represents the number of patients transferred from one state to another. Results The patients were grouped according to their states: that is, diagnoses, hemodialysis/transplantation procedures, and events such as death. A Sankey diagram with basic zooming and planning functions was developed that temporally and qualitatively depicts they had amid change of comorbidities occurred in pre- and post-CKD states. Discussion This represents a novel visualization approach for temporal patterns of polymorbidities associated with any complex disease and its outcomes. The Sankey diagram is a promising method for visualizing complex diseases and exploring the effect of comorbidities on outcomes in a time-evolution style. Conclusions This type of visualization may help clinicians foresee possible outcomes of complex diseases by considering comorbidities that the patients have developed.",

In fact, depending on the severity of the underlying disease, it is important to plan for a comprehensive safety evaluation at the start of any development program. Statisticians should be intimately involved in this process and contribute their expertise to study design, safety data collection, analysis, reporting (including data visualization), and interpretation. Methods: In this manuscript, we review the challenges associated with the analysis of safety endpoints and describe the safety data that are available to influence the design and analysis of premarket clinical trials. Results: We share our recommendations for the statistical and graphical methodologies necessary to appropriately analyze, report, and interpret safety outcomes, and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of safety data obtained from clinical trials compared to other sources. Conclusions: Clinical trials are an important source of safety data that contribute to the totality of safety information available to generate evidence for regulators, sponsors, payers, physicians, and patients. This work is a result of the efforts of the American Statistical Association Biopharmaceutical Section Safety Working Group.",

This article discusses the how SeeCollections gathers data from Kingsborough's discovery layer API (Application Programming Interface) and transforms these data to create visualizations for the Web. SeeCollections is a lightweight, proof-of-concept data application based on a vendor API. API data are often accessible in academic libraries but are frequently underutilized. SeeCollections was built to demonstrate the immediate value of these API data sources to Kingsborough librarians by providing a visual interface to discovery layer data. Keeping in mind the broader literature on data visualization, this article will explore how SeeCollections was built.",

Findings \u2013 With no technical knowledge required, focussing on metadata properties from a semantically annotated dataset could lead to automatically generated charts that allow to understand the dataset in an exploratory manner. Through interactive visualizations, users can navigate LOD sources using a natural approach, in order to save time and resources when dealing with an unknown resource for the first time. Research limitations/implications \u2013 This approach is suitable for available SPARQL endpoints and could be extended for resource description framework dumps loaded locally.

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>AIDSVu is a public resource for visualizing HIV surveillance data and other population-based information relevant to HIV prevention, care, policy, and impact assessment.<bold>Objective: </bold>The site, AIDSVu.org, aims to make data about the US HIV epidemic widely available, easily accessible, and locally relevant to inform public health decision making.<bold>Methods: </bold>AIDSVu develops visualizations, maps, and downloadable datasets using results from HIV surveillance systems, other population-based sources of information (eg, US Census and national probability surveys), and other data developed specifically for display and dissemination through the website (eg, pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] prescriptions). Other types of content are developed to translate surveillance data into summarized content for diverse audiences using infographic panels, interactive maps, local and state fact sheets, and narrative blog posts.<bold>Results: </bold>Over 10 years, AIDSVu.org has used an expanded number of data sources and has progressively provided HIV surveillance and related data at finer geographic levels, with current data resources providing HIV prevalence data down to the census tract level in many of the largest US cities. Data are available at the county level in 48 US states and at the ZIP Code level in more than 50 US cities. In 2019, over 500,000 unique users consumed AIDSVu data and resources, and HIV-related data and insights were disseminated through nearly 4,000,000 social media posts. Since AIDSVu's inception, at least 249 peer-reviewed publications have used AIDSVu data for analyses or referenced AIDSVu resources. Data uses have included targeting of HIV testing programs, identifying areas with inequitable PrEP uptake, including maps and data in academic and community grant applications, and strategically selecting locations for new HIV treatment and care facilities to serve high-need areas.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Surveillance data should be actively used to guide and evaluate public health programs; AIDSVu translates high-quality, population-based data about the US HIV epidemic and makes that information available in formats that are not consistently available in surveillance reports. Bringing public health surveillance data to an online resource is a democratization of data, and presenting information about the HIV epidemic in more visual formats allows diverse stakeholders to engage with, understand, and use these important public health data to inform public health decision making.",

The framework comprises three major steps. First, factor analysis is adopted to separate the scores of several different subjects into grading-related ones and grading-unrelated ones. Second, multidimensional scaling is employed for dimensionality reduction to facilitate subsequent data visualization and interpretation. Finally, a support vector machine is trained to classify the filtered data into different grades. This work provides an attractive framework for intelligent data analysis and decision making. It also exhibits the advantages of high classification accuracy and supports intuitive data interpretation.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>More than 79.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1.7 million deaths were caused by SARS-CoV-2; the disease was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Control of the COVID-19 epidemic has become a crucial issue around the globe, but there are limited studies that investigate the global trend of the COVID-19 pandemic together with each country's policy measures.<bold>Objective: </bold>We aimed to develop an online artificial intelligence (AI) system to analyze the dynamic trend of the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitate forecasting and predictive modeling, and produce a heat map visualization of policy measures in 171 countries.<bold>Methods: </bold>The COVID-19 Pandemic AI System (CPAIS) integrated two data sets: the data set from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker from the Blavatnik School of Government, which is maintained by the University of Oxford, and the data set from the COVID-19 Data Repository, which was established by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. This study utilized four statistical and deep learning techniques for forecasting: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), feedforward neural network (FNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM). With regard to 1-year records (ie, whole time series data), records from the last 14 days served as the validation set to evaluate the performance of the forecast, whereas earlier records served as the training set.<bold>Results: </bold>A total of 171 countries that featured in both databases were included in the online system. The CPAIS was developed to explore variations, trends, and forecasts related to the COVID-19 pandemic across several counties. For instance, the number of confirmed monthly cases in the United States reached a local peak in July 2020 and another peak of 6,368,591 in December 2020. A dynamic heat map with policy measures depicts changes in COVID-19 measures for each country. A total of 19 measures were embedded within the three sections presented on the website, and only 4 of the 19 measures were continuous measures related to financial support or investment. Deep learning models were used to enable COVID-19 forecasting; the performances of ARIMA, FNN, and the MLP neural network were not stable because their forecast accuracy was only better than LSTM for a few countries. LSTM demonstrated the best forecast accuracy for Canada, as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were 2272.551, 1501.248, and 0.2723075, respectively. ARIMA (RMSE=317.53169; MAPE=0.4641688) and FNN (RMSE=181.29894; MAPE=0.2708482) demonstrated better performance for South Korea.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The CPAIS collects and summarizes information about the COVID-19 pandemic and offers data visualization and deep learning-based prediction. It might be a useful reference for predicting a serious outbreak or epidemic. Moreover, the system undergoes daily updates and includes the latest information on vaccination, which may change the dynamics of the pandemic.",

The case study involved metadata and text data of 17,500 electric vehicle patents. To these ends, the following methodology was applied: First, feature engineering was based on topic extraction from patent texts using latent dirichlet analysis (LDA) and the perplexity metric. Second, the multi-label implementations of the random forest, decision trees, and KNN algorithms were trained on the data in order to predict multiple class labels corresponding to a given electric vehicle patent. The results of this study were promising, with the best scores for performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f-score, and hamming loss being 0.91, 0.92, 0.74, and 0.02 respectively. The implications of our results are two-fold: firstly, we present the effectiveness of using open-source tools for customized patent analysis pipelines including interactive data visualization and machine learning. Secondly, our results provide a strong basis for automated multi-label patent classification into CPC classes. \u2022 Natural language processing tools applied to patent information extraction and dynamic visualization. \u2022 Latent dirichlet analysis with perplexity applied to NLP-informed feature engineering. \u2022 Multi-label classification with random forest, decision trees, and KNN machine learning algorithms.",

Eighty-one participants completed an information retrieval task where the visualization techniques were used to display a corpus consisting of 50 short news texts. Human pairwise similarity judgments for this corpus were used to create the three proximity-based displays. Results demonstrated an advantage in accuracy, the number of documents accessed, and, to a lesser extent, subjective confidence in these displays over the Random List condition and in the 2D over the 1D displays. Similar, but smaller, advantages were observed in the MDS display over ISOMAP however none of these pairwise comparisons were statistically significant. A sequential analysis of participant actions in terms of the proximity of document representations accessed provided some explanation for variations in performance between the displays as well as indicating strategic differences in interactions particularly between visualizations of different dimensionality.",

We used machine learning, sentiment analysis, and text mining to analyze national and state level coverage of SNAP in order to gauge perceptions of the program over time across these outlets. Results indicate that the majority of news coverage has negative sentiment, more partisan news outlets have more extreme sentiment, and that clustering of negative reporting on SNAP occurs in the Midwest. Our final results and tools will be displayed in an online application that the ACFB Advocacy team can use to inform their communication to relevant stakeholders.",

        "Abstract": "Objective - To determine the most comprehensive database(s) for agricultural literature searching. Design - Data collection and analysis was conducted using a modified version of the bibliography method, overlap analysis, chi square tests, and data visualization methods. Setting - An academic library in the U.S. Subjects - Eight commonly used bibliographic databases, including comprehensive agricultural indexes (AGRICOLA, AGRIS, and CAB Abstracts), specialized databases (BIOSIS Previews and FSTA), and multidisciplinary databases (Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science). Methods - The researchers selected three review articles that represented sub-topics within the field of agriculture. Sources listed in the bibliographies of the three review articles were used to build a bibliographic citation set for analysis. Using a modified version of the bibliography method, 90 citations were randomly selected from the above-mentioned citation set. Researchers then turned to the 8 selected databases and searched for all 90 citations in each platform. Search queries were crafted in two ways: unique title strings in quotation marks and combinations of terms entered into the \"title\", \"keyword\", \"journal source\", and \"author\" fields. Citations were considered to be covered in a database if the full bibliographic record was located using the above-mentioned search strategy. Next, chi square tests were used to evaluate if the expected number of citations from the sample group were found in each database or if the frequency differed between the eight databases. The overlap analysis method provided numerical representation of the degree of similarity and difference across the eight databases. Finally, data visualizations created in Excel and Gephi enhanced comparisons between the eight databases and highlighted differences that were not obvious based solely on the analysis of numerical data. Main Results - Researchers found that comprehensive databases (AGRICOLA, AGRIS, and CAB Abstracts) were not in fact comprehensive in their coverage of agricultural literature. However, the results suggested that CAB Abstracts was more comprehensive than AGRICOLA or AGRIS, particularly in regard to its coverage of the sub-topics \"agronomy\" and \"meat sciences\". However, coverage of the sub-topic \"sustainable diets\" lagged behind multidisciplinary databases, which may be explained by the fact that the topic is interdisciplinary in nature. The superior coverage of CAB Abstracts over other comprehensive databases is consistent with findings reported by Kawasaki (2004). The analysis of specialized databases (BIOSIS Previews and FSTA) suggested that citations within the scope of the database were covered very well, while those out of scope were not. For instance, the sub-topics \"sustainable diets\" and \"meat science\" are out of scope of the biological sciences and thus, were not well covered in BIOSIS. The multidisciplinary databases (Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science) provided the most comprehensive coverage agricultural literature. All three databases covered most citations included in the data set. However, researchers noted that all three databases provided weak coverage of trade published items, books, or older journals. Conclusion - The study found that multidisciplinary databases provide close to full coverage of agricultural literature. In addition, they provide the best access to content that is interdisciplinary in nature. Specialized and comprehensive databases are recommended when research topics are within the scope of the database. Also, they best support in-depth projects such as bibliographies or comprehensive review articles.",

Methods: We conducted a descriptive analysis of authors' institutions and relationships, automatic content extraction of key words and phrases from titles and abstracts, and topic modeling and evolution. Data visualization techniques were applied to present the results of the analysis. Results: We found that leading research institutions on COVID-19 included the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the US National Institutes of Health, and the University of California. Research studies mostly involved collaboration among different institutions at national and international levels. In addition to bioRxiv, major publication venues included journals such as The BMJ, PLOS One, Journal of Virology, and The Lancet. Key research concepts included the coronavirus, acute respiratory impairments, health care, and social distancing. The ten most popular topics were identified through topic modeling and included human metapneumovirus and livestock, clinical outcomes of severe patients, and risk factors for higher mortality rate. Conclusion: Data analytics is a powerful approach for quickly processing and understanding large-scale datasets like CORD-19. This approach could help medical librarians, researchers, and the public understand important characteristics of COVID-19 research and could be applied to the analysis of other large datasets.",

This article presents a study of Reflext, an interactive visualization tool that leverages computational linguistic analysis to support reflection on the framing of political issues. This system was deployed in a field study, during which the tool was used by regular readers of political news coverage during the 2012 U.S. election campaign. The results describe the tool's support for a variety of activities related to frame reflection, how users integrated tool use with their existing reading practices, and broader issues in how participants interpreted the computational analysis and visualization. These findings contribute to our understanding of how algorithmically based interactive systems might mediate both the practical experiences of and situated interpretation of framing in political content.",

The purpose of this study is to use widely available and easily operated techniques that can satisfy general users in extracting specific knowledge to make the medical information system more functional. Data mining techniques, including data visualisation, correlation analysis, discriminant analysis, and neural networks supervised classification, were applied to heart disease databases. These techniques can help to identify high risk patients, define the most important factors (variables) in heart disease, and build a multivariate relationship model to show the relationship between any two variables in a way that such relationships are easy to view. Simple visualization techniques were utilised to construct this model, which corresponds with current medical knowledge. Two nonparametric (distribution assumption free) classification tools were employed to identify high risk heart disease patients. Both the neural networks supervised classification methods and the discriminant analysis method produced reliable classification rates for heart disease patients. However, neural networks yielded a higher percentage of correct classifications (averaging 89%) than discriminant analysis (79%). Data visualisation and correlation analysis resulted in similar conclusions regarding the most important factors in heart disease. These data mining tools provide simple and effective methods of extracting knowledge from general medical information. The treatment of missing data is also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Objectives: The University of Minnesota (UMN) Health Sciences Libraries conducted a needs assessment of public health researchers as part of a multi-institutional study led by Ithaka S+R. The aims of the study were to capture the evolving needs, opportunities, and challenges of public health researchers in the current environment and provide actionable recommendations. This paper reports on the data collected at the UMN site. Methods: Participants (n=24) were recruited through convenience sampling. One-on-one interviews, held November 2016 to January 2017, were audio-recorded. Qualitative analyses were conducted using NVivo 11 Pro and were based on the principles of grounded theory. Results: The data revealed that a broad range of skill levels among participants (e.g., literature searching) and areas of misunderstanding (e.g., current publishing landscape, open access options). Overall, data management was an afterthought. Few participants were fully aware of the breadth of librarian knowledge and skill sets, although many did express a desire for further skill development in information science. Conclusions: Libraries can engage more public health researchers by utilizing targeted and individualized marketing regarding services. We can promote open science by educating researchers on publication realities and enhancing our data visualization skills. Libraries might take an institution-wide leadership role on matters of data management and data policy compliance. Finally, as team science emerges as a research priority, we can offer our networking expertise. These support services may reduce the stresses that public health researchers feel in the current research environment.",

This paper provides technical information so readers can download data from referenced sites for analysis. Proper citation of data sources is emphasized.Design/methodology/approach The resources were compiled from teaching information and statistical literacy to diplomacy undergraduate and graduate students. Data and data sets described are relevant to country research and sustainable development.Findings Academic librarians will help students identify if they are looking for data specific to an agency, indicator, initiative, or general topic. Statistical literacy is also an underlying goal for academic librarians. Key word searching is important for finding sources that may not surface through a simple Google search.Research limitations/implications The free services described may not answer all research queries. Librarians may need to use services such as Political Risk Service\u2019s CountryData Online.Practical implications This is an excellent resource list of secondary data sources for academic librarians in areas that may not be their area of expertise or for those not at Tier 1 research institutions.Social implications Students internationally will have access to this data. This has implications for US college students who are competing with students overseas for jobs and will use data to help future employers make strategic decisions.Originality/value There has not been anything published recently in library literature about United Nations data resources.

A survey was conducted, and 186 valid responses were collected from faculty, researchers, and graduate students across different disciplines at a research university. The services for which researchers perceive the greatest need include assistance with quantitative analysis and data visualization. Overall, the need for data-related assistance is relatively higher among health scientists, while humanities researchers demonstrate the lowest need. This study also investigated the data formats used, data documentation and storage practices, and data-sharing behavior of researchers. We found that researchers rarely use metadata standards, but rely more on a standard file-naming scheme. As to data sharing, respondents are likely to share their data personally upon request or as supplementary materials to journal publications. The findings of this study will be useful for planning user-centered research data services in academic libraries.",

This study sought to advance the science of public health surveillance data visualization by conceptualizing a visual paradigm that provides an 'epidemiological canvas' for detection, monitoring, exploration and discovery of regional infectious disease activity and developing a software prototype of an 'infectious disease weather map'. Design objectives were elucidated and the conceptual model was developed using cognitive task analysis with public health epidemiologists. The software prototype was pilot tested using retrospective data from a large, regional pediatric hospital, and gastrointestinal and respiratory disease outbreaks were re-created as a proof of concept.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>A large quantity of data is collected during the delivery of cancer care. However, once collected, these data are difficult for health professionals to access to support clinical decision making and performance review. There is a need for innovative tools that make clinical data more accessible to support health professionals in these activities. One approach for providing health professionals with access to clinical data is to create the infrastructure and interface for a clinical dashboard to make data accessible in a timely and relevant manner.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aimed to develop and evaluate 2 prototype dashboards for displaying data on the identification and management of lymphedema.<bold>Methods: </bold>The study used a co-design framework to develop 2 prototype dashboards for use by health professionals delivering breast cancer care. The key feature of these dashboards was an approach for visualizing lymphedema patient cohort and individual patient data. This project began with 2 focus group sessions conducted with members of a breast cancer multidisciplinary team (n=33) and a breast cancer consumer (n=1) to establish clinically relevant and appropriate data for presentation and the visualization requirements for a dashboard. A series of fortnightly meetings over 6 months with an Advisory Committee (n=10) occurred to inform and refine the development of a static mock-up dashboard. This mock-up was then presented to representatives of the multidisciplinary team (n=3) to get preliminary feedback about the design and use of such dashboards. Feedback from these presentations was reviewed and used to inform the development of the interactive prototypes. A structured evaluation was conducted on the prototypes, using Think Aloud Protocol and semistructured interviews with representatives of the multidisciplinary team (n=5).<bold>Results: </bold>Lymphedema was selected as a clinically relevant area for the prototype dashboards. A qualitative evaluation is reported for 5 health professionals. These participants were selected from 3 specialties: surgery (n=1), radiation oncology (n=2), and occupational therapy (n=2). Participants were able to complete the majority of tasks on the dashboard. Semistructured interview themes were categorized into engagement or enthusiasm for the dashboard, user experience, and data quality and completeness.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Findings from this study constitute the first report of a co-design process for creating a lymphedema dashboard for breast cancer health professionals. Health professionals are interested in the use of data visualization tools to make routinely collected clinical data more accessible. To be used effectively, dashboards need to be reliable and sourced from accurate and comprehensive data sets. While the co-design process used to develop the visualization tool proved effective for designing an individual patient dashboard, the complexity and accessibility of the data required for a cohort dashboard remained a challenge.",

The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is striving to implement the enterprise-wide capability to collect and use PGD in order to partner with patients in their care, improve the patient healthcare experience, and promote shared decision making. Through knowledge gained from Veterans' and healthcare teams' perspectives, VA created a taxonomy and an evolving framework on which to design and develop applications that capture and help physicians utilize PGD. Ten recommendations for effectively collecting and integrating PGD into patient care are discussed, addressing health system culture, data value, architecture, policy, data standards, clinical workflow, data visualization, and analytics and population reach.",

        "Abstract": "Recent years have witnessed an incipient shift in science policy from a focus mainly on academic excellence to a focus that also takes into account \"societal impact\". This shift raises the question as to whether medical research has given proper attention to the diseases imposing the greatest burden on society. Therefore, with the aim of identifying correlations between research funding priorities and public demand in health, we examine grants issued by the major medical research funding bodies of China and the UK during 2006\u20132017 and compare the focus of their funded projects with the diseases that carry the highest burden of death, risk, or loss of health. The results indicate that the funding decisions of both nations do correspond to the illnesses with the highest health impact on their citizens. For both regions, the greatest health concerns surround non-communicable diseases, and neoplasms and cardiovascular disease in particular. In China, national health priorities have remained focused on these illnesses for the benefit of its own population, whereas the UK has funded a wider variety of research, extending to projects with impacts outside its borders to some developing countries. Additionally, despite an increased incidence of mental illness and HIV/AIDs in China, there is evidence that less priority has been given to these conditions. Both of these health areas seem to require more attention from China's national funding agencies and the society in general. Methodologically, this study can serve as an example of how to conduct analyses related to public health issues by combining informetric methods and data with the tools and data from other fields, thereby inspiring other scientometrics studies.",

        "Abstract": "Objectives -- To initiate or expand research data management (RDM) services within the participating libraries serving health sciences populations. Design -- Case report. Setting -- Six institutions consisting of three academic health sciences and three university libraries within the National Network of Libraries of Medicine Middle Atlantic Region in the United States of America. Subjects -- Between two and eight librarians participated from each institution, for a total of twenty-six librarian participants. Methods -- Pre-pilot phone interviews were conducted and included open-ended questions about RDM services, the library's motivation for participating, and their degree of institutional commitment. To deepen their understanding of RDM, the participants were required to complete eight educational modules that included text, videos, and quizzes. The participating institutions received data interview questions to connect with their research community to be better informed about their attitudes, language, and practices. The participants also received a Teaching Toolkit, complete with slides, a script, and an attendee evaluation form. The participants were provided with a data series, consisting of branded classes for teaching over a designated period with instructors from within and outside of the library. Collaboration with library partners was encouraged as was the use of a focused marketing plan. In fact, a major component of the pilot was the expert support, provided through biweekly meetings that included marketing tips and presentations on such topics as clinical research data management and data visualization. Finally, post-pilot program interviews were conducted, and the open-ended questions covered the pilot program as a whole and its individual components. Main Results -- Of the six participating institutions, five institutions rated the RDM educational modules very positively. Conducting data interviews was valuable for all six institutions because it allowed the librarians to meet with researchers, build relationships, and use what they learned to develop RDM services for the future. The Teaching Toolkit was rated positively by the six institutions, especially for its adaptability, the time saved over developing the content from scratch, and its usability. Finally, the two institutions that held the data series courses stated that the series succeeded in further marketing the RDM services developed by the library. Conclusion -- The pilot project met its objectives: the librarians at the participating institutions completed the educational modules, administered the data interviews, and taught an RDM foundations class based on the Teaching Toolkit. In addition, a data series was hosted at two institutions. The components of the pilot project had the intended results at each institution, and the classes were reviewed favorably. Based on the pilot participants' positive outcomes, the authors are certain that the freely available program materials would achieve success elsewhere.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Objectives: </bold>Patients increasingly use patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to self-monitor their health status. Visualizing PROs longitudinally (over time) could help patients interpret and contextualize their PROs. The study sought to assess hospitalized patients' objective comprehension (primary outcome) of text-only, non-graph, and graph visualizations that display longitudinal PROs.<bold>Materials and Methods: </bold>We conducted a clinical research study in 40 hospitalized patients comparing 4 visualization conditions: (1) text-only, (2) text plus visual analogy, (3) text plus number line, and (4) text plus line graph. Each participant viewed every condition, and we used counterbalancing (systematic randomization) to control for potential order effects. We assessed objective comprehension using the International Organization for Standardization protocol. Secondary outcomes included response times, preferences, risk perceptions, and behavioral intentions.<bold>Results: </bold>Overall, 63% correctly comprehended the text-only condition and 60% comprehended the line graph condition, compared with 83% for the visual analogy and 70% for the number line (P\u2009=\u2009.05) conditions. Participants comprehended the visual analogy significantly better than the text-only (P\u2009=\u2009.02) and line graph (P\u2009=\u2009.02) conditions. Of participants who comprehended at least 1 condition, 14% preferred a condition that they did not comprehend. Low comprehension was associated with worse cognition (P\u2009<\u2009.001), lower education level (P\u2009=\u2009.02), and fewer financial resources (P\u2009= .03).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The results support using visual analogies rather than text to display longitudinal PROs but caution against relying on graphs, which is consistent with the known high prevalence of inadequate graph literacy. The discrepancies between comprehension and preferences suggest factors other than comprehension influence preferences, and that future researchers should assess comprehension rather than preferences to guide presentation decisions.",

This conflicted relationship with pie charts has resulted largely from their paucity of data, labeling difficulties, and perceptual weaknesses. Like many primary data design genres, however, pie charts attained their conventional status as a result of a long evolutionary process, initiated in the later nineteenth century by experimentation, hybrid forms, and data-rich designs. After the subsequent simplification and minimizing effects of twentieth-century modernism, pie charts have begun to experience a reemergence of innovation with digital data design, which has reintroduced hybridity into pie charts, vastly enlarged their data domain, and addressed at least some of their perceived weaknesses.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Background: This project investigates the ways in which patients respond to the shared use of what is often considered private information: personal health data. There is a growing demand for patient access to personal health records. The predominant model for this record is a repository of all clinically relevant health information kept securely and viewed privately by patients and their health care providers. While this type of record does seem to have beneficial effects for the patient-physician relationship, the complexity and novelty of these data coupled with the lack of research in this area means the utility of personal health information for the primary stakeholders--the patients--is not well documented or understood. Objective: PatientsLikeMe is an online community built to support information exchange between patients. The site provides customized disease-specific outcome and visualization tools to help patients understand and share information about their condition. We begin this paper by describing the components and design of the online community. We then identify and analyze how users of this platform reference personal health information within patient-to-patient dialogues. Methods: Patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) post data on their current treatments, symptoms, and outcomes. These data are displayed graphically within personal health profiles and are reflected in composite community-level symptom and treatment reports. Users review and discuss these data within the Forum, private messaging, and comments posted on each other's profiles. We analyzed member communications that referenced individual-level personal health data to determine how patient peers use personal health information within patient-to-patient exchanges. Results: Qualitative analysis of a sample of 123 comments (about 2% of the total) posted within the community revealed a variety of commenting and questioning behaviors by patient members. Members referenced data to locate others with particular experiences to answer specific health-related questions, to proffer personally acquired disease-management knowledge to those most likely to benefit from it, and to foster and solidify relationships based on shared concerns. Conclusions: Few studies examine the use of personal health information by patients themselves. This project suggests how patients who choose to explicitly share health data within a community may benefit from the process, helping them engage in dialogues that may inform disease self-management. We recommend that future designs make each patient's health information as clear as possible, automate matching of people with similar conditions and using similar treatments, and integrate data into online platforms for health conversations.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Chronic diseases such as diabetes require high levels of medication adherence and patient self-management for optimal health outcomes. A novel sensing platform, Digital Health Feedback System (Proteus Digital Health, Redwood City, CA), can for the first time detect medication ingestion events and physiological measures simultaneously, using an edible sensor, personal monitor patch, and paired mobile device. The Digital Health Feedback System (DHFS) generates a large amount of data. Visual analytics of this rich dataset may provide insights into longitudinal patterns of medication adherence in the natural setting and potential relationships between medication adherence and physiological measures that were previously unknown. Objective: Our aim was to use modern methods of visual analytics to represent continuous and discrete data from the DHFS, plotting multiple different data types simultaneously to evaluate the potential of the DHFS to capture longitudinal patterns of medication-taking behavior and self-management in individual patients with type II diabetes. Methods: Visualizations were generated using time domain methods of oral metformin medication adherence and physiological data obtained by the DHFS use in 5 patients with type II diabetes over 37-42 days. The DHFS captured at-home metformin adherence, heart rate, activity, and sleep/rest. A mobile glucose monitor captured glucose testing and level (mg/dl). Algorithms were developed to analyze data over varying time periods: across the entire study, daily, and weekly. Following visualization analysis, correlations between sleep/rest and medication ingestion were calculated across all subjects. Results: A total of 197 subject days, encompassing 141,840 data events were analyzed. Individual continuous patch use varied between 87-98%. On average, the cohort took 78% (SD 12) of prescribed medication and took 77% (SD 26) within the prescribed \u00b12-hour time window. Average activity levels per subjects ranged from 4000-12,000 steps per day. The combination of activity level and heart rate indicated different levels of cardiovascular fitness between subjects. Visualizations over the entire study captured the longitudinal pattern of missed doses (the majority of which took place in the evening), the timing of ingestions in individual subjects, and the range of medication ingestion timing, which varied from 1.5-2.4 hours (Subject 3) to 11 hours (Subject 2). Individual morning self-management patterns over the study period were obtained by combining the times of waking, metformin ingestion, and glucose measurement. Visualizations combining multiple data streams over a 24-hour period captured patterns of broad daily events: when subjects rose in the morning, tested their blood glucose, took their medications, went to bed, hours of sleep/rest, and level of activity during the day. Visualizations identified highly consistent daily patterns in Subject 3, the most adherent participant. Erratic daily patterns including sleep/rest were demonstrated in Subject 2, the least adherent subject. Correlation between sleep/rest and medication ingestion in each individual subject was evaluated. Subjects 2 and 4 showed correlation between amount of sleep/rest over a 24-hour period and medication-taking the following day (Subject 2: r=.47, P<.02; Subject 4: r=.35, P<.05). With Subject 2, sleep/rest disruptions during the night were highly correlated (r=.47, P<.009) with missing doses the following day. Conclusions: Visualizations integrating medication ingestion and physiological data from the DHFS over varying time intervals captured detailed individual longitudinal patterns of medication adherence and self-management in the natural setting. Visualizing multiple data streams simultaneously, providing a data-rich representation, revealed information that would not have been shown by plotting data streams individually. Such analyses provided data far beyond traditional adherence summary statistics and may form the foundation of future personalized predictive interventions to drive longitudinal adherence and support optimal self-management in chronic diseases such as diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "Mobile phones and devices, with their constant presence, data connectivity, and multiple intrinsic sensors, can support around-the-clock chronic disease prevention and management that is integrated with daily life. These mobile health (mHealth) devices can produce tremendous amounts of location-rich, real-time, high-frequency data. Unfortunately, these data are often full of bias, noise, variability, and gaps. Robust tools and techniques have not yet been developed to make mHealth data more meaningful to patients and clinicians. To be most useful, health data should be sharable across multiple mHealth applications and connected to electronic health records. The lack of data sharing and dearth of tools and techniques for making sense of health data are critical bottlenecks limiting the impact of mHealth to improve health outcomes. We describe Open mHealth, a nonprofit organization that is building an open software architecture to address these data sharing and \"sense-making\" bottlenecks. Our architecture consists of open source software modules with well-defined interfaces using a minimal set of common metadata. An initial set of modules, called InfoVis, has been developed for data analysis and visualization. A second set of modules, our Personal Evidence Architecture, will support scientific inferences from mHealth data. These Personal Evidence Architecture modules will include standardized, validated clinical measures to support novel evaluation methods, such as n-of-1 studies. All of Open mHealth's modules are designed to be reusable across multiple applications, disease conditions, and user populations to maximize impact and flexibility. We are also building an open community of developers and health innovators, modeled after the open approach taken in the initial growth of the Internet, to foster meaningful cross-disciplinary collaboration around new tools and techniques. An open mHealth community and architecture will catalyze increased mHealth efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Increasing an individual's awareness and understanding of their dietary habits and reasons for eating may help facilitate positive dietary changes. Mobile technologies allow individuals to record diet-related behavior in real time from any location; however, the most popular software applications lack empirical evidence supporting their efficacy as health promotion tools. Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and acceptability of a popular social media software application (Twitter) to capture young adults' dietary behavior and reasons for eating. A secondary aim was to visualize data from Twitter using a novel analytic tool designed to help identify relationships among dietary behaviors, reasons for eating, and contextual factors. Methods: Participants were trained to record all food and beverages consumed over 3 consecutive days (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) using their mobile device's native Twitter application. A list of 24 hashtags (#) representing food groups and reasons for eating were provided to participants to guide reporting (eg, #protein, #mood). Participants were encouraged to annotate hashtags with contextual information using photos, text, and links. User experience was assessed through a combination of email reports of technical challenges and a 9-item exit survey. Participant data were captured from the public Twitter stream, and frequency of hashtag occurrence and co-occurrence were determined. Contextual data were further parsed and qualitatively analyzed. A frequency matrix was constructed to identify food and behavior hashtags that co-occurred. These relationships were visualized using GMap algorithmic mapping software. Results: A total of 50 adults completed the study. In all, 773 tweets including 2862 hashtags (1756 foods and 1106 reasons for eating) were reported. Frequently reported food groups were #grains (n=365 tweets), #dairy (n=221), and #protein (n=307). The most frequently cited reasons for eating were #social (activity) (n=122), #taste (n=146), and #convenience (n=173). Participants used a combination of study-provided hash tags and their own hash tags to describe behavior. Most rated Twitter as easy to use for the purpose of reporting diet-related behavior. \"Maps\" of hash tag occurrences and co-occurrences were developed that suggested time-varying diet and behavior patterns. Conclusions: Twitter combined with an analytical software tool provides a method for capturing real-time food consumption and diet-related behavior. Data visualization may provide a method to identify relationships between dietary and behavioral factors. These findings will inform the design of a study exploring the use of social media and data visualization to identify relationships between food consumption, reasons for engaging in specific food-related behaviors, relevant contextual factors, and weight and health statuses in diverse populations.

        "Abstract": "The continuous increase in computational capacity over the past years has produced an overwhelming flow of data or big data, which exceeds the capabilities of conventional processing tools. Big data signify a new era in data exploration and utilization. The MapReduce computational paradigm is a major enabler for underlying numerous big data platforms. MapReduce is a popular tool for the distributed and scalable processing of big data. It is increasingly being used in different applications primarily because of its important features, including scalability, fault tolerance, ease of programming, and flexibility. Thus, bibliometric analysis and review was conducted to evaluate the trend of MapReduce research assessment publications indexed in Scopus from 2006 to 2015. This trend includes the use of the MapReduce framework for big data processing and its development. The study analyzed the distribution of published articles, countries, authors, keywords, and authorship pattern. For data visualization, VOSviewer program was used to produce distance- and graph-based maps. The top 10 most cited articles were also identified based on the citation count of publications. The study utilized productivity measures, domain visualization techniques and co-word to explore papers related to MapReduce in the field of big data. Moreover, the study discussed the most influential articles contributed to the improvements in MapReduce and reviewed the corresponding solutions. Finally, it presented several open challenges on big data processing with MapReduce as future research directions.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: With the advent of the intelligent environment, as novice researchers, graduate students face digital challenges in their research topic selection (RTS). The purpose of this paper is to explore their cognitive processes during data-driven decision making (DDDM) in RTS, thus developing technical and instructional strategies to facilitate their research tasks. Design/methodology/approach: This study developes a theoretical model that considers data-driven RTS as a second-order factor comprising both rational and experiential modes. Additionally, data literacy and visual data presentation were proposed as an antecedent and a consequence of data-driven RTS, respectively. The proposed model was examined by employing structural equation modeling based on a sample of 931 graduate students. Findings: The results indicate that data-driven RTS is a second-order factor that positively affects the level of support of visual data presentation and that data literacy has a positive impact on DDDM in RTS. Furthermore, data literacy indirectly affects the level of support of visual data presentation. Practical implications: These findings provide support for developers of knowledge discovery systems, data scientists, universities and libraries on the optimization of data visualization and data literacy instruction that conform to students' cognitive styles to inform RTS. Originality/value: This paper reveals the cognitive mechanisms underlying the effects of data literacy and data-driven RTS under rational and experiential modes on the level of support of the tabular or graphical presentations. It provides insights into the match between the visualization formats and cognitive modes.",

Methods - This descriptive study has been conducted using scientometrics and a SNA approach. The researchers identified 523 publications on EBL, as indexed by Scopus and Web of Science with no date limitation. A range of software tools (Ravar PreMap, Netdraw, UCINet and VOSviewer) were utilized for data visualization and analysis. Results - Results of the study revealed that the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) occupied the topmost positions regarding centrality measures, clearly indicating their important structural roles in EBL research. The network of EBL research in terms of the degree of connectedness showed low density in the co-authorship networks of both authors (0.013) and countries (0.214). Seven subject clusters were identified in the EBL research network, four of which related to health and medicine. The occurrence of the keywords related to these four subject clusters suggested that EBL research had a greater association with the setting of health and medicine than with traditional librarianship elements such as human resources or library collection management. Conclusion - This study provided a systematic understanding of topics, research, and researchers in EBL by visualizing the networks and may thus inform the development of future aspects of EBL research and education.",

        "Abstract": "Background: A recent publication from Eli Lilly and Company provided guidance on incorporation of a structured benefit-risk assessment framework into Section 2.5.6 of the Clinical Overview of marketing authorization applications. Because a template alone cannot deliver a judicious benefit-risk evaluation, the purpose of this manuscript is to present lessons learned and practical approaches that pharmaceutical companies (sponsors) can apply in developing holistic benefit risk assessments of medicinal products for their marketing authorization applications. Methods: Benefit-risk scientists at Eli Lilly and Company facilitated use of a structured benefit-risk assessment in Section 2.5.6 of the Clinical Overview for a number of marketing authorization applications submitted to regulators between 2013 and the 2016. Based on our experiences in implementing the approach described in the publication by Wolka et al, we have identified commonalities that contributed to successful implementation. Results: The 3 key learnings from the authors\u2019 experience are to (1) use a cross-functional team approach; (2) employ a process that lends to the objectivity and efficiency of benefit-risk assessments; and (3) leverage data visualizations for clear and concise communication of benefit-risk information. Conclusions: Sponsors can apply these approaches to incorporate benefit-risk assessments into their marketing authorization applications. Further shared learnings and benchmarking among the pharmaceutical industry will be necessary to further advance the science and practice of benefit-risk assessment.",

        "Abstract": "Background: The quality of data from clinical trials has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Of central importance is the need to protect the well-being of study participants and maintain the integrity of final analysis results. However, traditional approaches to assess data quality have come under increased scrutiny as providing little benefit for the substantial cost. Numerous regulatory guidance documents and industry position papers have described risk-based approaches to identify quality and safety issues. In particular, the position paper of TransCelerate BioPharma recommends defining risk thresholds to assess safety and quality risks based on past clinical experience. This exercise can be extremely time-consuming, and the resulting thresholds may only be relevant to a particular therapeutic area, patient or clinical site population. In addition, predefined thresholds cannot account for safety or quality issues where the underlying rate of observing a particular problem may change over the course of a clinical trial, and often do not consider varying patient exposure. Methods: In this manuscript, we appropriate rules commonly utilized for funnel plots to define a traffic-light system for risk indicators based on statistical criteria that consider the duration of patient follow-up. Further, we describe how these methods can be adapted to assess changing risk over time. Finally, we illustrate numerous graphical approaches to summarize and communicate risk, and discuss hybrid clinical-statistical approaches to allow for the assessment of risk at sites with low patient enrollment. Results: We illustrate the aforementioned methodologies for a clinical trial in patients with schizophrenia. Conclusions: Funnel plots are a flexible graphical technique that can form the basis for a riskbased strategy to assess data integrity, while considering site sample size, patient exposure, and changing risk across time.",

Data visualization has the potential to address this challenge and support personalized cancer care. Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the health care practitioners' perceptions of and feedback regarding visualizations developed to support the care of individuals with multiple chronic conditions engaging in cancer care. Methods: Medical doctors (n=4) and registered nurses (n=4) providing cancer care at an academic medical center in the western United States provided feedback on visualization mock-ups. Mock-up designs were guided by current health informatics and visualization literature and the Munzner Nested Model for Visualization Design. User-centered design methods, a mock patient persona, and a scenario were used to elicit insights from participants. Directed content analysis was used to identify themes from session transcripts. Means and SDs were calculated for health care practitioners' rankings of overview visualizations. Results: Themes identified were data elements, supportive elements, confusing elements, interpretation, and use of visualization. Overall, participants found the visualizations useful and with the potential to provide personalized care. Use of color, reference lines, and familiar visual presentations (calendars, line graphs) were noted as helpful in interpreting data. Conclusions: Visualizations guided by a framework and literature can support health care practitioners' understanding of data for individuals with multiple chronic conditions engaged in cancer care. This understanding has the potential to support the provision of personalized care.",

        "Abstract": "The increasingly complex and rapidly changing global health and socioeconomic landscape requires fundamentally new ways of thinking, acting, and collaborating to solve growing systems challenges. Cross-sectoral collaborations between governments, businesses, international organizations, private investors, academia, and nonprofits are essential for lasting success in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and securing a prosperous future for the health and well-being of all people (United Nations, <xref>n.d</xref>.). Our aim is to use data science and innovative technologies to map diverse stakeholders and their initiatives around SDGs and specific health targets\u2014with particular focus on SDG 3 (Good Health & Well Being) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals)\u2014to accelerate cross-sector and multidisciplinary collaborations. Initially, the mapping tool focuses on Geneva, Switzerland as the world center of global health diplomacy with over 80 key stakeholders and influencers present. As we develop the next level pilot, we aim to build on users\u2019 interests, with a potential focus on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as one of the emerging and most pressing global health issues that requires new collaborative approaches. Building on this pilot, we can later expand beyond only SDG 3 to other SDGs.",

        "Abstract": "Text mining is a method that aids in the analytic process and interpretation of research. Voyant Tools (voyant-tools.org) is an open source text-mining option that is user-friendly and well documented. This tool was chosen as a test study for one of the latest projects, entitled Trials and Triumphs, at Middle Tennessee State University. The Trials and Triumphs project has been reengineered with new content, themes, and connections relating to Tennessee's history between 1865 and 1965. Transformations are not just the subject during this historic time period but are equally met with transformative technical upgrades to the project's previous interpretative layout. Digital Scholarship Initiatives at Middle Tennessee State University's Walker Library tested the application and use of Voyant Tools to determine whether its text analysis capabilities are well suited for the Trials and Triumphs revitalization project (now called Trials, Triumphs, and Transformations: Tennesseans' Search for Citizenship, Community, and Opportunity) and whether its interoperability with Drupal was worth pursuing. The author describes the results of this test study and consequently intends this article to be a practical guide for librarians or similar scholars who develop digital humanities projects, and who are interested in beginning a text mining project.",

        "Abstract": "Objective - To identify the data curation activities most valued by researchers at universities. Design - Focus group and survey instrument. Setting - Six R1: Doctoral Universities in the United States of America that are part of a Data Curation Network (DCN) project to design a shared data curation service. Subjects - 91 researchers, librarians, and support staff. Methods - The authors used focus group methodology to collect data about valued data curation activities, current practices, and satisfaction with existing services or activities. Six focus groups were conducted at participants' places of employment. Participants reviewed a list of 35 possible data curation activities, including documentation, data visualization, and rights management. A card-swapping exercise enabled subjects to rank the most important issues on a scale of 1-5, with \"most important\" activities becoming the subject of a facilitated discussion. In a short paper-based survey, participants also noted whether a data curation practice is in place at their institution, and their satisfaction with the practice. Main Results - Twelve data curation activities were identified as \"highly rated\" services that academic institutions could focus on providing to researchers. Documentation, Secure Storage, Quality Assurance, and Persistent Identifier were the data curation activities that the majority of participants rated as \"most important.\" Participants identified the data curation practices in place at their institutions, including documentation (80%), secure storage (75%), chain of custody (64%), metadata (63%), file inventory or manifest (58%), data visualization (58%), versioning (56%), file format transformations (55%), and quality assurance (52%). Participants reported low levels of satisfaction with their institutions' data curation activities. Conclusion - Academic libraries have an opportunity to develop or improve existing data curation services by focusing on the twelve data curation activities that researchers, staff, and librarians value but that could be implemented in a more satisfactory way. The authors conclude that their organization, the Data Curation Network, has an opportunity to improve data curation services or to offer new or expanded services.",

Technologies to store and access these complex and large datasets are in place. However, robust and scalable analysis technologies are needed to extract meaningful information from these datasets. The research field of Information Visualization and Visual Data Analytics addresses this need. Information visualization and data mining are often used complementary to each other. Their common goal is the extraction of meaningful information from complex and possibly large data. However, though data mining focuses on the usage of silicon hardware, visualization techniques also aim to access the powerful image-processing capabilities of the human brain. This article highlights the research on data visualization and visual analytics techniques. Furthermore, we highlight existing visual analytics techniques, systems, and applications including a perspective on the field from the chemical process industry.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Visual analytics (VA) promotes the understanding of data with visual, interactive techniques, using analytic and visual engines. The analytic engine includes automated techniques, whereas common visual outputs include flow maps and spatiotemporal hot spots. Objective: This scoping review aims to address a gap in the literature, with the specific objective to synthesize literature on the use of VA tools, techniques, and frameworks in interrelated health care areas of population health and health services research (HSR). Methods: Using the 2018 PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, the review focuses on peer-reviewed journal articles and full conference papers from 2005 to March 2019. Two researchers were involved at each step, and another researcher arbitrated disagreements. A comprehensive abstraction platform captured data from diverse bodies of the literature, primarily from the computer and health sciences. Results: After screening 11,310 articles, findings from 55 articles were synthesized under the major headings of visual and analytic engines, visual presentation characteristics, tools used and their capabilities, application to health care areas, data types and sources, VA frameworks, frameworks used for VA applications, availability and innovation, and co-design initiatives. We found extensive application of VA methods used in areas of epidemiology, surveillance and modeling, health services access, use, and cost analyses. All articles included a distinct analytic and visualization engine, with varying levels of detail provided. Most tools were prototypes, with 5 in use at the time of publication. Seven articles presented methodological frameworks. Toward consistent reporting, we present a checklist, with an expanded definition for VA applications in health care, to assist researchers in sharing research for greater replicability. We summarized the results in a Tableau dashboard. Conclusions: With the increasing availability and generation of big health care data, VA is a fast-growing method applied to complex health care data. What makes VA innovative is its capability to process multiple, varied data sources to demonstrate trends and patterns for exploratory analysis, leading to knowledge generation and decision support. This is the first review to bridge a critical gap in the literature on VA methods applied to the areas of population health and HSR, which further indicates possible avenues for the adoption of these methods in the future. This review is especially important in the wake of COVID-19 surveillance and response initiatives, where many VA products have taken center stage.

        "Abstract": "This study sought to provide a descriptive analysis of the research output pertaining to Continuous Professional Development (CPD) of librarians. CPD is crucial as it upgrades employees' skills and has the potential to increase productivity and improve customer service in libraries. Therefore, there is need for extensive research in this area. Web of Science (WoS) core collection database was used to retrieve sample data for the bibliometric analysis. A total of 165 records were retrieved. After abstract screening, 77 records specific to CPD of librarians were analysed. A statistical software package called R (Biblioshiny) and VOSviewer were used for data visualization. This study was limited to publications written in English and indexed on WoS only. The study findings revealed that most productive countries in this research area are the USA, the United Kingdom and Australia. In Africa, Nigeria and South Africa have taken the lead. In terms of most productive institutions, University of Nigeria and the University of Sheffield ranked first. Considering the publication period, 2009 and 2013 were the most productive. Library Trends and Journal of Librarianship & Information Science are the most productive publishers. Research on CPD of librarians is dominant in academic libraries, hence there is need for similar studies to be conducted in public and school libraries. Most prolific authors are E. Hornung G. Hallam and S. Lewis. However, F. M. Mason and M. R. Kennedy have the highest number of citations. The citation impact shows that research activity pertaining to CPD of librarians is very low. Low research productivity in CPD of librarians may inhibit informed decision making due to lack of availability of scientific research output. As a result, libraries may continue to have an unskilled and irrelevant workforce that does not meet the changing demands of the 21st century users. Especially African countries and other developing nations. Therefore, this paper has attempted to raise awareness on the research dynamics pertaining to CPD of librarians through bibliometric analysis. It is hoped that this work will trigger more research interest in LIS discipline.",

        "Abstract": "Visible Human Dataset (VHD) is a remarkable piece of raw digital anatomical knowledge still to be fully exploited. Colours of VHD anatomic images are the natural targets of different algorithmic approaches devoted to understanding the content of the complex digital medical images, but they have never been analysed exhaustively. A full colorimetric characterization of all 9000 VHD colour images may help to take advantage of implicit available information in raw data. This study describes a novel colorimetric characterization and a Visual Knowledge Discovery tool, using methods from database field, data visualization, and image analysis. The applied heterogeneous methods allowed us to develop a histogram meta database and make it available remotely. It consists of a histogram-based colorimetric characterization of the all VHD 24-bit colour images. A user-friendly, interactive, and intuitive 3D framework providing 3D services was built and made freely available. It allows real-time analysis of colour component characteristics of a user-defined set of VHD images providing 3D interactive navigation of the histogram meta database. New knowledge can be discovered using our tool and the histogram meta database provided. This work allowed us to propose novel methods for colour image characterization and obtained results using developed service on VHD colour images let us to partially understand the not fully satisfactorily results achieved so far analysing these images.",

        "Abstract": "During and after the Great Recession, U.S. public library advocacy messages focused on cuts in funding and significantly increased utilization of services, particularly technology services. This article analyzes quantitative evidence appearing in advocacy materials and offers alternative data for evaluating the validity of claims made in such materials. For the most part, summary statistical accounts of the experiences of public libraries during the recession paint an incomplete picture. It is suggested that portraying U.S. libraries in general as \u201cdoing more with less\u201d is a considerable overstatement since the majority of libraries had funding increases in the aftermath of the recession. Only 23 percent of all U.S. public libraries delivered more services while simultaneously experiencing funding decreases. The article recommends that library advocacy campaigns strive to present accurate, balanced, and complete information in their promotional materials.",

        "Abstract": "The study of literature is changing in dramatic ways, stimulated by new opportunities that digital technology presents. Data visualization upends the dynamic for literary analysis, focusing not on questions stemming from a critic's personal viewpoint but on revealing and displaying connections between elements of the literary experience. The dominant association between critic and text is downplayed, replaced with associations within the text and between it and its context. The basis of interpretation shifts from reading to seeing, from qualitative analysis to quantitative. The reader's role is transformed, as well, from following the critic's path of thinking to actively exploring a network of multisensory and interdisciplinary information. The distinction between the authoritative presenter/critic and the learner/explorer is blurred. By inviting literary scholars to ask different questions for computational analysis, digital technology and visualization inspire innovative investigations and enable new insights.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to share the research processes and results of secondary analysis using GIS to map usage of a university library to contribute to ongoing efforts to help identify how library spaces are used to explain how university libraries can continue to evolve as teaching, learning, and shared communities of scholars. This paper details the use of ArcGIS to visualize where students are in the library in order to explain how this method can used by libraries to visualize the use of their facilities. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 This research utilized secondary analysis of data collected during seating sweeps; through secondary analysis, data were analyzed and visualized in ArcGIS. The seating sweeps were conducted three times a day during a sample week, with researchers noting on maps of the library floor plan where students were sitting. Data were entered into an ArcGIS database file and mapped to display usage directly on the library map to improve stakeholders\u2019 understanding of the ways students are using the library as a place. Findings \u2013 Even though this project used consistent instruments and procedural instructions and trained observers, a combination of factors resulted in an incomplete data set, including the length of time between research design and data collection and lack of agreement about the use of map worksheets. It was still possible to make maps that depict heavier and lighter areas of use, present data to library stakeholders, and show what can be accomplished when data are collected on copies of the floor plan. Research limitations/implications \u2013 This research is limited by being a conducted in one university library, but the implications far outweigh the limitations. While bar and pie charts are effective at visualizing data, they do not provide a way to visualize where activities occur; maps provide multi-layered visualization, allowing libraries to visualize the same usage data as bar, pie, or other charts in addition to seeing where that usage occurs. The implications for librarianship include better understanding of how library spaces are used and the ability to use visually appealing maps to demonstrate the library\u2019s use, value, and impact. Originality/value \u2013 Mapping library statistics is an area that has been growing in the last decade, but practical examples of using GIS to map facility usage are few. This paper explains in detail how the mapping process works and how libraries of all types can adapt this method for their own usage assessments to more vividly depict the value and impact of the library facility as a place.",

        "Abstract": "Anyone who has clarified a thought or prompted a response during a conversation by drawing a picture has exploited the potential of image making to convey information. Images are increasingly ubiquitous in daily communication due to advances in visually enabled information and communication technologies ( ICT), such as information visualization applications, image retrieval systems, and virtual collaborative work tools. Although images are often used in social contexts, information science research concerned with the visual representation of information typically focuses on the image artifact and system building. To learn more about image making as a form of social interaction and as a form of information practice, a qualitative study examined face-to-face conversations involving the creation of ad hoc visualizations (i.e., 'napkin drawings'). Interactional sociolinguistic concepts of conversational involvement and coordination guided multimodal analysis of video-recorded interactions that included spontaneous drawing. Findings show patterns in communicative activities associated with the visual representation of information. Furthermore, the activity of mark making contributes to the maintenance of conversational involvement in ways that are not always evident in the drawn artifact. This research has implications for the design and evaluation of visually enabled virtual collaboration environments, visual information extraction and retrieval systems, and data visualization tools.",

More specifically, it analyses the chronological growth of TM literature, and the major countries, institutions, departments and individuals contributing to TM literature. Collaboration in TM research is also analysed. Design/methodology/approach - Bibliographic and citation data required for this research were retrieved from the WoS database. TM being a multidisciplinary field, the search was restricted to \"Information Science Library Science\" subcategory in the WoS. A comprehensive query statement covering all synonyms of \"text mining\" was prepared using the Boolean operator \"OR\". Microsoft Excel and HistCite software were used for data analysis. Pajek and VoSviewer were used for data visualization. Findings - It was found that USA is the major producer of TM research literature, and the highest number of papers were published in the Journal of The American Medical Informatics. Columbia University ranked first both in number of articles and citations received in the top ten institutes publishing TM literature. It was also observed that six of the top ten subdivisions of institutions are either from medicine or medical informatics or biomedical information. H.C. Chen and C. Friedman were seen to be the most prolific authors. Research limitations/implications - The paper analyses articles on TM published during 1999-2013 in WoS under the subcategory Information Science Library Science'.

There were also indications of data skills gaps in these subject areas and other data-related topics. Case Presentation: The data services team enlisted instructors from across the medical center with data expertise to teach in a series of classes hosted by the library. We hosted eight classes branded as a series called \"Data Day to Day.\" Seven instructors from four units in the medical center, including the library, taught the classes. A multipronged outreach approach resulted in high turnout. Evaluations indicated that attendees were very satisfied with the instruction, would use the skills learned, and were interested in future classes. Conclusions: Data Day to Day met previously unaddressed data skills gaps. Collaborating with outside instructors allowed the library to serve as a hub for a broad range of data instruction and to raise awareness of library services. We plan to offer the series three times in the coming year with an expanding roster of classes.",

Christine L. Borgman recalls being intrigued as a student when hearing about the history of bibliometrics, and she sees expanding metrics research methods as one of the most significant recent advances in the field. Blaise Cronin speaks of reading, meeting and corresponding with leaders in the field from early in his own career. He is impressed by the rise of journals other than JASIST covering informetrics, reflecting expanding interest in the field. Katherine W. McCain was drawn to the field when she was recognized for a citation analysis and collection assessment carried out while she served as a biology librarian. Among the challenges McCain identifies are more meaningful analysis of huge datasets, research funding and gaining understanding through the different perspectives of boundary spanners. Howard White recalls how a friendly conversation led to special access to a proprietary data gathering tool, resulting in the first author co-citation map and his co-authoring a highly acclaimed article. He notes significant advances in the mathematical foundations of bibliometrics and a rise in importance of bibliometrics for assessing national research programs. All four researchers are pleased to see the rise of altmetrics and data visualization capabilities, though they share concerns about the validity and reliability of metrics-based research and trustworthiness of platforms and data sets.",

Over the last decade, the use of Web-based data in public health issues, that is, infodemiology, has been proven useful in assessing various aspects of human behavior. Google Trends is the most popular tool to gather such information, and it has been used in several topics up to this point, with health and medicine being the most focused subject. Web-based behavior is monitored and analyzed in order to examine actual human behavior so as to predict, better assess, and even prevent health-related issues that constantly arise in everyday life.<bold>Objective: </bold>This systematic review aimed at reporting and further presenting and analyzing the methods, tools, and statistical approaches for Google Trends (infodemiology) studies in health-related topics from 2006 to 2016 to provide an overview of the usefulness of said tool and be a point of reference for future research on the subject.<bold>Methods: </bold>Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for selecting studies, we searched for the term \"Google Trends\" in the Scopus and PubMed databases from 2006 to 2016, applying specific criteria for types of publications and topics. A total of 109 published papers were extracted, excluding duplicates and those that did not fall inside the topics of health and medicine or the selected article types. We then further categorized the published papers according to their methodological approach, namely, visualization, seasonality, correlations, forecasting, and modeling.<bold>Results: </bold>All the examined papers comprised, by definition, time series analysis, and all but two included data visualization. A total of 23.1% (24/104) studies used Google Trends data for examining seasonality, while 39.4% (41/104) and 32.7% (34/104) of the studies used correlations and modeling, respectively. Only 8.7% (9/104) of the studies used Google Trends data for predictions and forecasting in health-related topics; therefore, it is evident that a gap exists in forecasting using Google Trends data.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The monitoring of online queries can provide insight into human behavior, as this field is significantly and continuously growing and will be proven more than valuable in the future for assessing behavioral changes and providing ground for research using data that could not have been accessed otherwise.",

One major set of technological innovations known as OLAP (On- line Analytic Processing) were tested in three-year, exploratory research project to improve the decision making of child protective service staff related to federal CFSR (Child and Family Services Review) standards. The OLAP application developed, called DEMOS (Data Enhanced Management Online Support) contained 6000+ clickable charts. Staff using a standard browser on the agency's intranet could drill down from statewide to unit level data and could slice & dice by clicking on staff, agency, and client characteristics such as client gender and age. This article explains OLAP technology and illustrates its use in DEMOS. The development process is described along with lessons learned and next steps. While DEMOS success measures, frequency of use, and improved decision making, were difficult to establish given the limited time that DEMOS was operational, DEMOS was well accepted by users and top management deployed OLAP tools to visually present other data within the agency.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose Studies of Spanish literature during the late nineteenth century and the first one-third of the twentieth century are evolving from research on canonical writers to the study of \u201codd and forgotten\u201d authors, themes and genres during what is now called the Other Silver Age. This paper aims to focus on the work undertaken in the field of literary translation by the women writers of this period.Design/methodology/approach Mnemosyne is an open-access digital library that allows data modeling for specific collections (women translators, science fiction, etc.) in support of research and teaching on Silver Age Spain. The first version of the library is stored on the server at the Universidad Complutense Library, and it is linked to the collections of the digital library HathiTrust and Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a. Behind the scenes of Mnemosyne\u2019s public presence online, the project is developing with the aid of the tool Clavy which is a rich internet application that is able to import, preserve and edit information from big data collections of digital objects so as to build bridges between institutional and digital repositories and create collections of enriched digital content. See:<ext-link>http://repositorios.fdi.ucm.es/mnemosine/queesmnemosine.php</ext-link>Findings The Collection Women Translators in Spain (1868-1936) inside Mnemosyne selects, categorizes and makes visible in digital format women translators and literary translations that belong to a forgotten repertoire to allow the historical review of the period. The digital collection of Spanish Women Translators pretends to be a field of international experimentation for the creation of interoperable semantic networks through which a large group of scholars could generate innovative research and theoretical reading models for literary texts. See:<ext-link>http://repositorios.fdi.ucm.es/mnemosine/colecciones.php</ext-link>Research limitations/implications Clavy also provides a basic system of data visualization, edition and navigation. There are plans to integrate @Note, a collaborative annotation application, into Clavy. These two computational tools were developed by the software languages research group ILSA[1] at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid.Practical implications Its been followed NEWW Women Writers\u2019 categories concerning biographical categories as successful standard for ensuring interoperability in the near future: children, marital status, social class, religion, profession and other activities, financial aspects, memberships. See:<ext-link>http://repositorios.fdi.ucm.es/mnemosine/ver_documento.php?documento=208369</ext-link>Social implications These women also showed their interest in the writings of contemporary women by translating their works into Spanish or glossing foreign ideas about how the modern woman should be, think or behave. This digital collection shows the first steps of the intellectual women in the South of Europe.Originality/value To incorporate specially tailored metadata for the women translators\u2019 collection into Mnemosyne, it will be necessary to use of Clavy\u2019s extensibility to account for the particularities of the women translators\u2019 collection. This is where prior knowledge of this literature\u2019s historical and cultural context proves indispensable. In particular, the specific metadata model for the women translators\u2019 collection incorporates elements that reflect the literary, historical and cultural characteristics of the collections.",

The main output of COSA is a dissimilarity matrix that one can subsequently analyze with a variety of proximity analysis methods. Our package extends the original COSA software (Friedman and Meulman, 2004) by adding functions for hierarchical clustering methods, least squares multidimensional scaling, partitional clustering, and data visualization. In the many publications that cite the COSA paper by Friedman and Meulman (2004), the COSA program is actually used only a small number of times. This can be attributed to the fact that this original implementation is not very easy to install and use. Moreover, the available software is out-of-date. Here, we introduce an up-to-date software package and a clear guidance for this advanced technique. The software package and related links are available for free at: .",

        "Abstract": "Background: Health care organizations gather large volumes of data, which has been traditionally stored in legacy formats making it difficult to analyze or use effectively. Though recent government-funded initiatives have improved the situation, the quality of most existing data is poor, suffers from inconsistencies, and lacks integrity. Generating reports from such data is generally not considered feasible due to extensive labor, lack of reliability, and time constraints. Advanced data analytics is one way of extracting useful information from such data. Objective: The intent of this study was to propose how Business Intelligence (BI) techniques can be applied to health system infrastructure data in order to make this information more accessible and comprehensible for a broader group of people. Methods: An integration process was developed to cleanse and integrate data from disparate sources into a data warehouse. An Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) cube was then built to allow slicing along multiple dimensions determined by various key performance indicators (KPIs), representing population and patient profiles, case mix groups, and healthy community indicators. The use of mapping tools, customized shape files, and embedded objects further augment the navigation. Finally, Web forms provide a mechanism for remote uploading of data and transparent processing of the cube. For privileged information, access controls were implemented. Results: Data visualization has eliminated tedious analysis through legacy reports and provided a mechanism for optimally aligning resources with needs. Stakeholders are able to visualize KPIs on a main dashboard, slice-and-dice data, generate ad hoc reports, and quickly find the desired information. In addition, comparison, availability, and service level reports can also be generated on demand. All reports can be drilled down for navigation at a finer granularity. Conclusions: We have demonstrated how BI techniques and tools can be used in the health care environment to make informed decisions with reference to resource allocation and enhancement of the quality of patient care. The data can be uploaded immediately upon collection, thus keeping reports current. The modular design can be expanded to add new datasets such as for smoking rates, teen pregnancies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) rates, immunization coverage, and vital statistical summaries.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Background: Engagement has emerged as a significant cross-cutting concern within the development of Web-based interventions. There have been calls to institute a more rigorous approach to the design of Web-based interventions, to increase both the quantity and quality of engagement. One approach would be to use log-data to better understand the process of engagement and patterns of use. However, an important challenge lies in organizing log-data for productive analysis. Objective: Our aim was to conduct an initial exploration of the use of visualizations of log-data to enhance understanding of engagement with Web-based interventions. Methods: We applied exploratory sequential data analysis to highlight sequential aspects of the log data, such as time or module number, to provide insights into engagement. After applying a number of processing steps, a range of visualizations were generated from the log-data. We then examined the usefulness of these visualizations for understanding the engagement of individual users and the engagement of cohorts of users. The visualizations created are illustrated with two datasets drawn from studies using the SilverCloud Platform: (1) a small, detailed dataset with interviews (n=19) and (2) a large dataset (n=326) with 44,838 logged events. Results: We present four exploratory visualizations of user engagement with a Web-based intervention, including Navigation Graph, Stripe Graph, Start-Finish Graph, and Next Action Heat Map. The first represents individual usage and the last three, specific aspects of cohort usage. We provide examples of each with a discussion of salient features. Conclusions: Log-data analysis through data visualization is an alternative way of exploring user engagement with Web-based interventions, which can yield different insights than more commonly used summative measures. We describe how understanding the process of engagement through visualizations can support the development and evaluation of Web-based interventions. Specifically, we show how visualizations can (1) allow inspection of content or feature usage in a temporal relationship to the overall program at different levels of granularity, (2) detect different patterns of use to consider personalization in the design process, (3) detect usability issues, (4) enable exploratory analysis to support the design of statistical queries to summarize the data, (5) provide new opportunities for real-time evaluation, and (6) examine assumptions about interactivity that underlie many summative measures in this field.",

Although academia is taking an active role in evaluating digital sensing products, academic contributions to advancing the safe, effective, ethical, and equitable use of digital clinical measures are poorly characterized.<bold>Objective: </bold>We performed a systematic review to characterize the nature of academic research on digital clinical measures and to compare and contrast the types of sensors used and the sources of funding support for specific subareas of this research.<bold>Methods: </bold>We conducted a PubMed search using a range of search terms to retrieve peer-reviewed articles reporting US-led academic research on digital clinical measures between January 2019 and February 2021. We screened each publication against specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. We then identified and categorized research studies based on the types of academic research, sensors used, and funding sources. Finally, we compared and contrasted the funding support for these specific subareas of research and sensor types.<bold>Results: </bold>The search retrieved 4240 articles of interest. Following the screening, 295 articles remained for data extraction and categorization. The top five research subareas included operations research (research analysis; n=225, 76%), analytical validation (n=173, 59%), usability and utility (data visualization; n=123, 42%), verification (n=93, 32%), and clinical validation (n=83, 28%). The three most underrepresented areas of research into digital clinical measures were ethics (n=0, 0%), security (n=1, 0.5%), and data rights and governance (n=1, 0.5%). Movement and activity trackers were the most commonly studied sensor type, and physiological (mechanical) sensors were the least frequently studied. We found that government agencies are providing the most funding for research on digital clinical measures (n=192, 65%), followed by independent foundations (n=109, 37%) and industries (n=56, 19%), with the remaining 12% (n=36) of these studies completely unfunded.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Specific subareas of academic research related to digital clinical measures are not keeping pace with the rapid expansion and adoption of digital sensing products. An integrated and coordinated effort is required across academia, academic partners, and academic funders to establish the field of digital clinical measures as an evidence-based field worthy of our trust.",

The goal of the website is to help patients answer the question: \"Given my status, what is the best outcome I can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?\" Objective: Using a cross-sectional online survey, we sought to describe the potential benefits of PatientsLikeMe in terms of treatment decisions, symptom management, clinical management, and outcomes. Methods: Almost 7,000 members from six PatientsLikeMe communities (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], Multiple Sclerosis [MS], Parkinson's Disease, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], fibromyalgia, and mood disorders) were sent a survey invitation using an internal survey tool (PatientsLikeMe Lens). Results: Complete responses were received from 1323 participants (19% of invited members). Between-group demographics varied according to disease community. Users perceived the greatest benefit in learning about a symptom they had experienced; 72% (952 of 1323) rated the site \"moderately\" or \"very helpful.\" Patients also found the site helpful for understanding the side effects of their treatments (n = 757, 57%). Nearly half of patients (n = 559, 42%) agreed that the site had helped them find another patient who had helped them understand what it was like to take a specific treatment for their condition. More patients found the site helpful with decisions to start a medication (n = 496, 37%) than to change a medication (n = 359, 27%), change a dosage (n = 336, 25%), or stop a medication (n = 290, 22%). Almost all participants (n = 1,249, 94%) were diagnosed when they joined the site. Most (n = 824, 62%) experienced no change in their confidence in that diagnosis or had an increased level of confidence (n = 456, 34%). Use of the site was associated with increasing levels of comfort in sharing personal health information among those who had initially been uncomfortable. Overall, 12% of patients (n = 151 of 1320) changed their physician as a result of using the site; this figure was doubled in patients with fibromyalgia (21%, n = 33 of 150). Patients reported community-specific benefits: 41% of HIV patients (n = 72 of 177) agreed they had reduced risky behaviors and 22% of mood disorders patients (n = 31 of 141) agreed they needed less inpatient care as a result of using the site. Analysis of the Web access logs showed that participants who used more features of the site (eg, posted in the online forum) perceived greater benefit. Conclusions: We have established that members of the community reported a range of benefits, and that these may be related to the extent of site use. Third party validation and longitudinal evaluation is an important next step in continuing to evaluate the potential of online data-sharing platforms.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Delivery of behavioral health interventions on the internet offers many benefits, including accessibility, cost-effectiveness, convenience, and anonymity. In recent years, an increased number of internet interventions have been developed, targeting a range of conditions and behaviors, including depression, pain, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and eating disorders. Human support (coaching) is a common component of internet interventions that is intended to boost engagement; however, little is known about how participants interact with coaches and how this may relate to their experience with the intervention. By examining the data that participants produce during an intervention, we can characterize their interaction patterns and refine treatments to address different needs.<bold>Objective: </bold>In this study, we employed text mining and visual analytics techniques to analyze messages exchanged between coaches and participants in an internet-delivered pain management intervention for adolescents with chronic pain and their parents.<bold>Methods: </bold>We explored the main themes in coaches' and participants' messages using an automated textual analysis method, topic modeling. We then clustered participants' messages to identify subgroups of participants with similar engagement patterns.<bold>Results: </bold>First, we performed topic modeling on coaches' messages. The themes in coaches' messages fell into 3 categories: Treatment Content, Administrative and Technical, and Rapport Building. Next, we employed topic modeling to identify topics from participants' message histories. Similar to the coaches' topics, these were subsumed under 3 high-level categories: Health Management and Treatment Content, Questions and Concerns, and Activities and Interests. Finally, the cluster analysis identified 4 clusters, each with a distinguishing characteristic: Assignment-Focused, Short Message Histories, Pain-Focused, and Activity-Focused. The name of each cluster exemplifies the main engagement patterns of that cluster.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>In this secondary data analysis, we demonstrated how automated text analysis techniques could be used to identify messages of interest, such as questions and concerns from users. In addition, we demonstrated how cluster analysis could be used to identify subgroups of individuals who share communication and engagement patterns, and in turn facilitate personalization of interventions for different subgroups of patients. This work makes 2 key methodological contributions. First, this study is innovative in its use of topic modeling to provide a rich characterization of the textual content produced by coaches and participants in an internet-delivered behavioral health intervention. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of a visual analysis method to cluster participants and identify similar patterns of behavior based on intervention message content.",

        "Abstract": "This paper reports on an action research project with public sector organizations in the UK which experimented with a range of digital methods (social media data mining, social network and issue network mapping and data visualization), in order to explore their potential usefulness for the public engagement activities of these organizations. We argue that there is a need for small-scale, qualitative studies of cultures of large-scale, quantitative data like ours, to open up spaces in which to reflect critically on the methods with which such data are produced. However, in this paper we highlight the difficulties we had enacting through action research a commitment to both the potential (which might be seen as the action part of action research)andthe problems (which might be seen as the research part of action research) of digital methods. Following Hammersley [(2002).Action research: A contradiction in terms?Exeter: British Educational Research Association], we suggest that an equal balance between action and research may always be difficult to sustain, in both action researchandthe use of digital methods. Despite this, we argue that critical discussion of digital methods needs to extend beyond academic spaces \u2013 through this move, we suggest, we might open up a space in which to reflect on how these methods might be used for the public good.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Clinical sequencing data should be shared in order to achieve the sufficient scale and diversity required to provide strong evidence for improving patient care. A distributed research network allows researchers to share this evidence rather than the patient-level data across centers, thereby avoiding privacy issues. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) used in distributed research networks has low coverage of sequencing data and does not reflect the latest trends of precision medicine.<bold>Objective: </bold>The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a genomic CDM (G-CDM), as an extension of the OMOP-CDM, for application of genomic data in clinical practice.<bold>Methods: </bold>Existing genomic data models and sequencing reports were reviewed to extend the OMOP-CDM to cover genomic data. The Human Genome Organisation Gene Nomenclature Committee and Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature were adopted to standardize the terminology in the model. Sequencing data of 114 and 1060 patients with lung cancer were obtained from the Ajou University School of Medicine database of Ajou University Hospital and The Cancer Genome Atlas, respectively, which were transformed to a format appropriate for the G-CDM. The data were compared with respect to gene name, variant type, and actionable mutations.<bold>Results: </bold>The G-CDM was extended into four tables linked to tables of the OMOP-CDM. Upon comparison with The Cancer Genome Atlas data, a clinically actionable mutation, p.Leu858Arg, in the EGFR gene was 6.64 times more frequent in the Ajou University School of Medicine database, while the p.Gly12Xaa mutation in the KRAS gene was 2.02 times more frequent in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. The data-exploring tool GeneProfiler was further developed to conduct descriptive analyses automatically using the G-CDM, which provides the proportions of genes, variant types, and actionable mutations. GeneProfiler also allows for querying the specific gene name and Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature to calculate the proportion of patients with a given mutation.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>We developed the G-CDM for effective integration of genomic data with standardized clinical data, allowing for data sharing across institutes. The feasibility of the G-CDM was validated by assessing the differences in data characteristics between two different genomic databases through the proposed data-exploring tool GeneProfiler. The G-CDM may facilitate analyses of interoperating clinical and genomic datasets across multiple institutions, minimizing privacy issues and enabling researchers to better understand the characteristics of patients and promote personalized medicine in clinical practice.",

Trends change rapidly in today's world, prompting this key question: What is the mechanism behind the emergence of new trends? By representing real-world dynamic systems as complex networks, the emergence of new trends can be symbolized by vertices that \"shine.\" That is, at a specific time interval in a network's life, certain vertices become increasingly connected to other vertices. This process creates new high-degree vertices, i.e., network stars. Thus, to study trends, we must look at how networks evolve over time and determine how the stars behave. In our research, we constructed the largest publicly available network evolution dataset to date, which contains 38,000 real-world networks and 2.5 million graphs. Then, we performed the first precise wide-scale analysis of the evolution of networks with various scales. Three primary observations resulted: (a) links are most prevalent among vertices that join a network at a similar time; (b) the rate that new vertices join a network is a central factor in molding a network's topology; and (c) the emergence of network stars (high-degree vertices) is correlated with fast-growing networks. We applied our learnings to develop a flexible network-generation model based on large-scale, real-world data. This model gives a better understanding of how stars rise and fall within networks, and is applicable to dynamic systems both in nature and society.

In conjunction with the Pathway Tools software, MetaCyc can be used to computationally predict the metabolic pathway complement of an annotated genome. To increase the breadth of pathways and enzymes, more than 60 plant-specific pathways have been added or updated in MetaCyc recently. In contrast to MetaCyc, which contains metabolic data for a wide range of organisms, AraCyc is a species-specific database containing only enzymes and pathways found in the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). AraCyc (http://arabidopsis.org/tools/aracyc/) was the first computationally predicted plant metabolism database derived from MetaCyc. Since its initial computational build, AraCyc has been under continued curation to enhance data quality and to increase breadth of pathway coverage. Twenty-eight pathways have been manually curated from the literature recently. Pathway predictions in AraCyc have also been recently updated with the latest functional annotations of Arabidopsis genes that use controlled vocabulary and literature evidence. AraCyc currently features 1,418 unique genes mapped onto 204 pathways with 1,156 literature citations. The Omics Viewer, a user data visualization and analysis tool, allows a list of genes, enzymes, or metabolites with experimental values to be painted on a diagram of the full pathway map of AraCyc. Other recent enhancements to both MetaCyc and AraCyc include implementation of an evidence ontology, which has been used to provide information on data quality, expansion of the secondary metabolism node of the pathway ontology to accommodate curation of secondary metabolic pathways, and enhancement of the cellular component ontology for storing and displaying enzyme and pathway locations within subcellular compartments.",

        "Abstract": "This paper considers the history of keywords used in Marketing Science to develop insights on the evolution of marketing science. Several findings emerge. First, \"pricing\" and \"game theory\" are the most ubiquitous words. More generally, the three C's and four P's predominate, suggesting that keywords and common practical frameworks align. Various trends exist. Some words, like \"pricing,\" remain popular over time. Others, like \"game theory\" and \"hierarchical Bayes,\" have become more popular. Finally, some words are superseded by others, like \"diffusion\" by \"social networking.\" Second, the overall rate of new keyword introductions has increased, but the likelihood they will remain in use has decreased. This suggests a maturation of the discipline or a long-tail effect. Third, a correspondence analysis indicates three distinct eras of marketing modeling, comporting roughly with each of the past three decades. These eras are driven by the emergence of new data and business problems, suggesting a fluid field responsive to practical problems. Fourth, we consider author publication survival rates, which increase up to six papers and then decline, possibly as a result of changes in ability or motivation. Fifth, survival rates vary with the recency and nature of words. We conclude by discussing the implications for additional journal space and the utility of standardized classification codes.",

The most popular criteria known are recall and precision. But these two are not totally accepted and respected in application. Uncertainty and giving more respect to information technology at the expense of information system management are the main problems. Although information retrieval includes many elements such as modality, document classification and categorization, system architecture, user interfaces, data visualization, filtering, language, and behavioral sciences, communication in a good environment covers all of them. For better communication, a classifier/indexer must avoid taking false direction, be frank and careful not to use ambiguous terms, and must provide sufficient cross-references in their indexing. Good questioning and saying no when it should be said is regarded as a kind of filtration of the environment from noises.",

Recent time and motion studies have consistently found that this impact is negligible; whereas qualitative studies have repeatedly revealed negative end-user perceptions suggesting decreased efficiency and disrupted workflow. We speculate that this discrepancy may be due in part to the design of the time and motion studies, which is focused on measuring clinicians' 'time expenditures' among different clinical activities rather than inspecting clinical 'workflow' from the true 'flow of the work' perspective. In this paper, we present a set of new analytical methods consisting of workflow fragmentation assessments, pattern recognition, and data visualization, which are accordingly designed to uncover hidden regularities embedded in the flow of the work. Through an empirical study, we demonstrate the potential value of these new methods in enriching workflow analysis in clinical settings.",

        "Abstract": "Background: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap places special emphasis on \"bench-to-bedside\" research, or the \"translation\" of basic science research into practical clinical applications. The Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Consortium is one example of the large investments being made to develop a national infrastructure to support translational science, which involves reducing regulatory burdens, launching new educational initiatives, and forming partnerships between academia and industry. However, while numerous definitions have been suggested for translational science, including the qualitative T1-T4 classification, a consensus has not yet been reached. This makes it challenging to tract the impact of these major policy changes. Methods: In this study, we use a bibliometric approach to map PubMed articles onto a graph, called the Triangle of Biomedicine. The corners of the triangle represent research related to animals, cells and molecules, and humans; and, the position of a publication on the graph is based on its topics, as determined by its Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). We define translation as movement of a collection of articles, or the articles that cite those articles, towards the human corner. Results: The Triangle of Biomedicine provides a quantitative way of determining if an individual scientist, research organization, funding agency, or scientific field is producing results that are relevant to clinical medicine. We validate our technique using examples that have been previously described in the literature and by comparing it to prior methods of measuring translational science. Conclusions: The Triangle of Biomedicine is a novel way to identify translational science and track changes over time. This is important to policy makers in evaluating the impact of the large investments being made to accelerate translation. The Triangle of Biomedicine also provides a simple visual way of depicting this impact, which can be far more powerful than numbers alone.",

        "Abstract": "For academic librarians seeking to demonstrate the value of their libraries to their parent institutions, it is important to understand not only the current climate. We must also know what will be valued in the future so that we can begin to take appropriate action now. This document presents 26 possible scenarios based on an implications assessment of current trends, which may have an impact on all types of academic and research libraries over the next 15 years. The scenarios represent themes relating to academic culture, demographics, distance education, funding, globalization, infrastructure/facilities, libraries, political climate, publishing industry, societal values, students/learning and technology. They are organized in a \u201cscenario space\u201d visualization tool, reflecting the expert judgment of ACRL members as to their expectations and perceptions about the probability, impact, speed of change and threat/opportunity potential of each scenario. Finally, the study draws out implications for academic libraries. For scenarios which have been identified as high impact with a high probability of occurring, it is incumbent upon library directors and those who set strategic agendas for academic libraries to plan to act now upon these scenarios. This report reinforces the notion that academic libraries are part of a larger ecosystem, and librarians should be consistently scanning the environment to look for signs of the changes that may come. It includes an appendix with a suggested activity to engage library colleagues in stretching your imaginations and considering possible futures. This can build capacity to engage in strategic thinking and planning, supporting librarians in making better decisions now that can address a variety of possible futures.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Factors like dehydration and respiratory infection pose risks to infant survival in the critical first 28 days of life. UNICEF reported the 2016 global rate of neonatal death was 19 per 1000 live births. Typically, women manage multiple household and family responsibilities in addition to care of a new baby and often feel overwhelmed by the demands of new motherhood. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that support to new mothers be an ongoing process, rather than a single postnatal visit. However, in low-resource environments such as developing countries and remote communities, access to ongoing support for breastfeeding, health education, and infant check-ups from a professional health care provider or health worker may not be possible. Numerous examples exist of successful mobile health interventions in low-resource environments. However, existing mobile apps for newborn health often focus on single issues that are disconnected from health care providers. There is a need to comprehensively address multiple newborn health issues, with evidence-based and personalized interventions that support new mothers. Objective: This study aims to design and build a prototype of a mobile app to comprehensively identify early signs and symptoms of common newborn illnesses, access relevant evidence-based health information, and support decision-making with the overall goal of enhancing new mothers' ability to improve newborn health outcomes. The prototype will be used in a future pragmatic trial. Methods: An interdisciplinary and international team including nursing, medicine, dietary, health informatics, and public health collaborated on this study. First, a literature review was conducted to supplement the team's existing knowledge on common neonatal problems, generate the evidence base for appropriate in-home interventions, and identify best practices in breast feeding. Second, a review of current mobile apps available in neonatal risks was conducted to assess gaps with attention to comprehensiveness of health issues, interface/integration with clinical decision support systems, and application of user-centered design and state of the art design principles and standards. Results: Our app, First 28, works offline for easy accessibility and displays evidence-based best practices and guidelines, personalized for mothers based on risks. Using a tailored symptoms list and computerized data entry to gather information, the mobile app performs analysis using a decision table algorithm to identify the risks the baby might encounter and suggests best solutions based on the outcomes. Mothers can submit images or crucial information about their baby and track growth through the app's data visualization tools. Data is stored on a FHIR server for integration with health care services and electronic health records. Future plans include automated data and image analytics of the uploaded information to alert health care providers of any abnormalities that may provide critical early evidence for potential neonatal risks and complications. Conclusions: First 28 empowers mothers with the knowledge and resources to maintain proper breastfeeding techniques, assess newborn health risks, and improve health outcomes within the crucial first 28 days of life. In the next phase, the prototype will be evaluated by users with a plan to utilize it in a pragmatic trial.",

In this paper the authors refine the EN model and present the foundation of EN to support social businesses. Then they introduce a case study on China automobile supply network (CASN). For the similarity with social networks, they verify power-law and small world theories in EN with statistical results on this data set. These theories are fitful in EN, but some new characteristics exist. The structure of EN consists of star-shaped clusters and the authors extract ego networks taking suppliers and manufacturers as the ego respectively. With the structure and distribution features of EN, they present the enterprise business similarity analysis method based on common-neighbors. And they also introduce the tentative work to detect Dunbar circles in EN. To analyze the data in a more intuitional and effective way, the authors use some data visualization tools to process the data in EN.",

However, the road for new technologies from \"lab to village\" is neither simple nor straightforward. Until recently, there has been no conceptual framework for analyzing and addressing the myriad forces and issues involved in moving health technologies from the lab to those who need them. Recently, based on empirical research, we published such a model. In this paper, we focus on extending the model into a dashboard and examine how this dashboard can be used to manage the information related to the path from lab to village. The next step will be for groups interested in global health, and even the public via the Internet, to use the tool to help guide technologies down this tricky path to improve global health and foster human development.

The most significant modern literary archive is that of premier poetry publishers Carcanet Press, whose correspondence is now largely digital in nature. The Library's Carcanet Press E-mail Preservation Project (2012\u201314) addressed the urgent need to acquire and safeguard this internationally significant digital archive for the future. The project resulted in the successful rescue and preservation of 215,000 e-mails and 65,000 attachments generated by Carcanet Press. It has also ensured that the Library is equipped to deal with regular accruals to the archive in the future. The project's work was recognized in 2014, when it received the Digital Preservation Coalition's prestigious biennial award for \u201cSafeguarding the Digital Legacy.\u201d This case study explores some of the challenges and opportunities involved in acquiring and preserving e-mail archives such as this one, addressing issues of acquisition, appraisal, format migration, authenticity, access\u2014via traditional finding aids and newer technologies such as data visualization\u2014and use.

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of the red blood cells, resulting in multiple acute and chronic complications, including pain episodes, stroke, and kidney disease. Patients with SCD develop chronic organ dysfunction, which may progress to organ failure during disease exacerbations. Early detection of acute physiological deterioration leading to organ failure is not always attainable. Machine learning techniques that allow for prediction of organ failure may enable early identification and treatment and potentially reduce mortality.<bold>Objective: </bold>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that machine learning physiomarkers can predict the development of organ dysfunction in a sample of adult patients with SCD admitted to intensive care units (ICUs).<bold>Methods: </bold>We applied diverse machine learning methods, statistical methods, and data visualization techniques to develop classification models to distinguish SCD from controls.<bold>Results: </bold>We studied 63 sequential SCD patients admitted to ICUs with 163 patient encounters (mean age 30.7 years, SD 9.8 years). A subset of these patient encounters, 22.7% (37/163), met the sequential organ failure assessment criteria. The other 126 SCD patient encounters served as controls. A set of signal processing features (such as fast Fourier transform, energy, and continuous wavelet transform) derived from heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate was identified to distinguish patients with SCD who developed acute physiological deterioration leading to organ failure from patients with SCD who did not meet the criteria. A multilayer perceptron model accurately predicted organ failure up to 6 hours before onset, with an average sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 98%, respectively.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This retrospective study demonstrated the viability of using machine learning to predict acute organ failure among hospitalized adults with SCD. The discovery of salient physiomarkers through machine learning techniques has the potential to further accelerate the development and implementation of innovative care delivery protocols and strategies for medically vulnerable patients.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to describe how 3D printing and scanning technology was implemented by the Dalhousie University Libraries in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Insights will be outlined about the benefits of these technologies in terms of data visualization and archival practices, as well as the potential user base for library-centered 3D printing and scanning services. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 This paper describes why the Dalhousie University Libraries purchased a 3D printer and scanner, the challenges of maintaining these technologies and instructing students in their use, and how Dalhousie faculty members and students have made use of these technologies for their own research purposes. Findings \u2013 3D printing and scanning technologies can be of use to a much wider range of Faculties than have traditionally had access to them. The unique role libraries have on university campuses allows them to function as universal access points for these technologies. By offering 3D scanning technology, they can also use this technology internally for archival purposes. Originality/value \u2013 While much has been written on 3D printing and scanning technology, very little has been written about how these technologies could relate to academic libraries. This paper sets the groundwork for further exploration into how 3D technologies can improve and expand library services.",

        "Abstract": "Background: New possibilities for mHealth have arisen by means of the latest advances in mobile communications and technologies. With more than 1 billion smartphones and 100 million tablets around the world, these devices can be a valuable tool in health care management. Every aid for health care is welcome and necessary as shown by the more than 50 million estimated deaths caused by illnesses or health conditions in 2008. Some of these conditions have additional importance depending on their prevalence. Objective: To study the existing applications for mobile devices exclusively dedicated to the eight most prevalent health conditions by the latest update (2004) of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) of the World Health Organization (WHO): iron-deficiency anemia, hearing loss, migraine, low vision, asthma, diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis (OA), and unipolar depressive disorders. Methods: Two reviews have been carried out. The first one is a review of mobile applications in published articles retrieved from the following systems: IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge, and PubMed. The second review is carried out by searching the most important commercial app stores: Google play, iTunes, BlackBerry World, Windows Phone Apps+Games, and Nokia's Ovi store. Finally, two applications for each condition, one for each review, were selected for an in-depth analysis. Results: Search queries up to April 2013 located 247 papers and more than 3673 apps related to the most prevalent conditions. The conditions in descending order by the number of applications found in literature are diabetes, asthma, depression, hearing loss, low vision, OA, anemia, and migraine. However when ordered by the number of commercial apps found, the list is diabetes, depression, migraine, asthma, low vision, hearing loss, OA, and anemia. Excluding OA from the former list, the four most prevalent conditions have fewer apps and research than the final four. Several results are extracted from the in-depth analysis: most of the apps are designed for monitoring, assisting, or informing about the condition. Typically an Internet connection is not required, and most of the apps are aimed for the general public and for nonclinical use. The preferred type of data visualization is text followed by charts and pictures. Assistive and monitoring apps are shown to be frequently used, whereas informative and educational apps are only occasionally used. Conclusions: Distribution of work on mobile applications is not equal for the eight most prevalent conditions. Whereas some conditions such as diabetes and depression have an overwhelming number of apps and research, there is a lack of apps related to other conditions, such as anemia, hearing loss, or low vision, which must be filled.

        "Abstract": "Background: Advances in ubiquitous computing, smart homes, and sensor technologies enable novel, longitudinal health monitoring applications in the home. Many home monitoring technologies have been proposed to detect health crises, support aging-in-place, and improve medical care. Health professionals and potential end users in the lay public, however, sometimes question whether home health monitoring is justified given the cost and potential invasion of privacy. Objective: The aim of the study was to elicit specific feedback from health professionals and laypeople about how they might use longitudinal health monitoring data for proactive health and well-being. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 8 health professionals and 26 laypeople. Participants were asked to evaluate mock data visualization displays that could be generated by novel home monitoring systems. The mock displays were used to elicit reactions to longitudinal monitoring in the home setting as well as what behaviors, events, and physiological indicators people were interested in tracking. Results: Based on the qualitative data provided by the interviews, lists of benefits of and concerns about health tracking from the perspectives of the practitioners and laypeople were compiled. Variables of particular interest to the interviewees, as well as their specific ideas for applications of collected data, were documented. Conclusions: Based upon these interviews, we recommend that ubiquitous \"monitoring\" systems may be more readily adopted if they are developed as tools for personalized, longitudinal self-investigation that help end users learn about the conditions and variables that impact their social, cognitive, and physical health.",

In this study, we aim to use machine learning to automatically analyze and explore historical documents from a text analysis and visualization perspective. This technology solves the problem of large-scale historical data analysis that is difficult for humans to read and intuitively understand. In this study, we use the historical documents of the Qing Dynasty Hetu Dangse, preserved in the Archives of Liaoning Province, as data analysis samples. China's Hetu Dangse is the largest Qing Dynasty thematic archive with Manchu and Chinese characters in the world. Through word frequency analysis, correlation analysis, co-word clustering, word2vec model, and SVM (Support Vector Machines) algorithms, we visualize historical documents, reveal the relationships between functions of the government departments in the Shengjing area of the Qing Dynasty, achieve the automatic classification of historical archives, improve the efficient use of historical materials as well as build connections between historical knowledge. Through this, archivists can be guided practically in historical materials' management and compilation.",

        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Creating an interactive, accurate, and low-latency big data visualisation is challenging due to the volume, variety, and velocity of the data. Visualisation options range from visualising the entire big dataset, which could take a long time and be taxing to the system, to visualising a small subset of the dataset, which could be fast and less taxing to the system but could also lead to a less-beneficial visualisation as a result of information loss. The main research questions investigated by this work are what effect sampling has on visualisation insight and how to provide guidance to users in navigating this trade-off. To investigate these issues, we study an initial case of simple estimation tasks on histogram visualisations of sampled big data, in hopes that these results may generalise. Leveraging sampling, we generate subsets of large datasets and create visualisations for a crowd-sourced study involving a simple cognitive visualisation task. Using the results of this study, we quantify insight, sampling, visualisation, and perception error in comparison to the full dataset. We use these results to model the relationship between sample size and insight error, and we propose the use of our model to guide big data visualisation sampling.",

With the new release, a completely revised tool has been published. It is not only based on citation data (bibliometrics), but also Mendeley data (altmetrics). Thus, the institutional impact measurement of the tool has been expanded by focusing on additional status groups besides researchers such as students and librarians. Furthermore, the visualization of the data has been completely updated by improving the operability for the user and including new features such as institutional profile pages. In this paper, we describe the datasets for the current excellencemapping.net tool and the indicators applied. Furthermore, the underlying statistics for the tool and the use of the web application are explained.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "The volume of freely available accounting information is rapidly becoming overwhelming. To be useful, information needs to be delivered to users in a suitable, relevant, and understandable form. Interactive data visualisation (IDV) can help address this need for useful information by organising accounting information, especially financial reports, into forms with these qualities. Given both their prevalence and their likelihood of being future users of IDV, the purpose of this research is to examine the appropriateness of IDV for non-professional investors' use when they access accounting information. This research uses a 2 \u00d7 2 experimental approach involving 404 participants representing non-professional investors from diverse demographic backgrounds. This research suggests that IDV mitigates non-professional investors' restricted investment capabilities by presenting information that is more salient, thus reducing non-professional investors' cognitive effort. This combination allows such investors to better perform both simple and multipart investment tasks. By integrating three information systems' fit perspectives (i.e. task technology, information quality, and cognitive), this research explains IDV's suitability and fit within the accounting domain. We also discuss how the findings can inform practice and span interdisciplinary research into data and information visualisation.",

        "Abstract": "During various learning activities, teachers and students need to clarify, explore and share their understanding of reading materials. For doing this, they must make explicit the mental representation constructed during the reading process. In this article, we propose an approach combining semantic annotations and semantic networks as formal means for elicitation, structuring, formalisation, analysis and sharing of teachers' and students' understanding of textual materials that they are asked to read in learning tasks. In the proposed approach, teachers can create learning tasks, in which students are asked to semantically annotate a text by associating portions of it to resources described in a Knowledge Base (KB) in accordance with a provided ontology. New instances can be created by students or teachers in the KB during the annotation process. We show how semantic networks can be used to visualise extracts of the resulting KB, and to help people organise their comprehension of texts. In addition, teachers can assess student evolution by analysing the semantic networks that each one produces during the reading and annotation process. This approach is implemented by using our annotation tool, integrated with a digital repository and a virtual learning environment. An empirical evaluation of the benefits of the proposed approach in a literature case study confirms that it facilitates information extraction, sharing and analysis, contributing to leverage teaching and learning.",

The key point is to explicitly force a visualization based on a spherical Gaussian mixture to inherit from the within cluster overlap that is present in the initial clustering mixture. The result is a particularly user-friendly drawing of the clusters, providing any practitioner with an overview of the potentially complex clustering result. An entropic measure provides information about the quality of the drawn overlap compared with the true one in the initial space. The proposed method is illustrated on four real data sets of different types (categorical, mixed, functional, and network) and is implemented on the r package ClusVis.",

LineSets are used to visualise sets and networks. The increasingly common nature of such data suggests that having effective visualisations is important. Unlike many approaches to set and network visualisation, which often use concave or convex shapes to represent sets alongside graphs, LineSets use lines overlaid on a graph. LineSets have been shown to be advantageous over shape-based approaches. However, the graphical properties of LineSets have not been fully explored. Our results suggest that automatically drawn LineSets can be significantly improved for certain tasks through the considered use of colour alongside size variations applied to their graphical elements. In particular, we show that perceptually distinguishable colours, lines of varying width, and nodes of varying diameter lead to improved task performance in automatically laid-out LineSets.",

The instrument was approved in terms of validity and reliability (a=98%). SPSS 21 was used for analyzing data. Then, a list of 85 Key Performance Indicators (KPI) was organized for designing the digital dashboard. A three-layer architecture was selected as the architectural pattern, and the conceptual model of the system was developed by applying the UML. Finally, the Qlikview was utilized to design the dashboard for the visualization of information. Twelve main features, including 85 KPIs, were determined for designing dashboards. User interface items were visualized using the most important features and KPIs. By applying a designed dashboard, academic managers can identify trends, strengths, and weaknesses. Moreover, visualized information can help users to gain insights and make decisions as quickly as possible.",

This study aimed at conducting a bibliometric overview and visualization of the scientific output of JDoc from its inception in 1945\u20132018. Design/methodology/approach: In this bibliometric study, 2056 papers published in JDoc were analyzed. All needed data were extracted from Scopus in 9 July 2019 in CSV format. Bibliometric analyses were done in Microsoft Excel. Visualization was done by Vosviewer software and applying techniques such as co-citation, co-authorship and co-occurrence. As a limited altmetric study, JDoc highly mentioned papers and the rate of their presence in social media were extracted from Altmetric LLP, too. Findings: There was an increasing trend in published papers and received citations. Highly cited and most influential authors in JDoc are well-known in the field. However, the contributions of developing countries and their affiliated institutions to the journal were relatively low. This is true in case of author, country and institute co-authorship patterns. Highly frequent keywords and keyword co-occurrence patterns showed that the journal considered most topics related to LIS, including newly emerged ones. The authors and sources (generally journals) cited by JDoc are all prolific and influential ones. Originality/value: The results of this study can be beneficial to JDoc editorial team for decision making on its further development as well as helpful for researchers and practitioners interesting in LIS field to have better contact with and contributions to the journal.",

First, it implements a spatial-temporal visualization of the Hakka genealogical information system that makes these individual family pedigree charts appear as one seamless genealogy to family and researchers seeking connections and family history all over the world. Second, this study applies migration analysis by applying big data technologies to Hakka genealogies to investigate the migration patterns of the Hakka ethnic group in Taiwan between 1954 and 2014. This innovative library service enhances the Hakka genealogical migration analysis using big data.Design/methodology/approach The platform is designed for the exchange of genealogical data to be used in big data analysis. This study integrates big data and geographic information systems (GIS) to map the population distribution themes. The general procedure included collecting genealogical big data, geographic encoding, gathering the map information, GIS layer integration and migration map production.Findings The analytical results demonstrate that big data technology is highly appropriate for family migration history analysis, given the increasing volume, velocity and variety of genealogical data. The spatial-temporal visualization of the genealogical research platform can follow family history and migration paths, and dynamically generate roadmaps to simplify the cartographic steps.Practical implications Technology that combines big data and GIS is suitable for performing migration analysis based on genealogy. A web-based application for spatial-temporal genealogical information also demonstrates the contribution of innovative library services.Social implications Big data play a dominant role in library services, and in turn, provide an active library service. These findings indicate that big data technology can provide a suitable tool for improving library services.Originality/value Online genealogy and family trees are linked with large-volume, growing data sets that are complex and have multiple, autonomous sources. The migration analysis using big data has the potential to help genealogy researchers to construct minority ethnic history.",

Methods An electronic literature search was conducted May-July 2013 using MEDLINE and Web of Knowledge, supplemented by citation searching, gray literature searching, and reference list reviews. General search terms were used to assure a comprehensive document search. Results Beginning with 891 articles, the number of articles was reduced by eliminating 191 duplicates. A matrix was developed for categorizing all abstracts and to assist with determining those to be excluded for review. Eighteen articles were included in the final analysis. Discussion Several visualization techniques have been extensively researched. The most mature system is LifeLines and its applications as LifeLines2, EventFlow, and LifeFlow. Initially, research focused on records from a single patient and visualization of the complex data related to one patient. Since 2010, the techniques under investigation are for use with large numbers of patient records and events. Most are linear and allow interaction through scaling and zooming to resize. Color, density, and filter techniques are commonly used for visualization. Conclusions With the burgeoning increase in the amount of electronic healthcare data, the potential for knowledge discovery is significant if data are managed in innovative and effective ways. We identify challenges discovered by previous EHR visualization research, which will help researchers who seek to design and improve visualization techniques.",

The participants consisted of 126 higher education students enrolled in the 12-week Computer Networks and Communication course. Data gathered through logs and academic performances of learners were analysed with data mining techniques. The result of cluster analysis, based on interaction with the prescriptive learning dashboard, showed that learners were separated into four groups according to their behavioural patterns. A similar pattern appears when the related clusters are profiled based on the academic performances. At predictive analysis, the study indicates that the interaction with prescriptive learning dashboard had certain effects on academic performance of learners significantly and artificial neural networks algorithm yielded the best performance for predicting academic performance. The results support that the usage prescriptive learning dashboards can be applied in online courses as an instructional aid to improve performance of learners and learning design in e-learning environments.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Objective: </bold>India reported its first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case in the state of Kerala and an outbreak initiated subsequently. The Department of Health Services, Government of Kerala, initially released daily updates through daily textual bulletins for public awareness to control the spread of the disease. However, these unstructured data limit upstream applications, such as visualization, and analysis, thus demanding refinement to generate open and reusable datasets.<bold>Materials and Methods: </bold>Through a citizen science initiative, we leveraged publicly available and crowd-verified data on COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala from the government bulletins and media outlets to generate reusable datasets. This was further visualized as a dashboard through a front-end Web application and a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) repository, which serves as an application programming interface for the front end.<bold>Results: </bold>From the sourced data, we provided real-time analysis, and daily updates of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, through a user-friendly bilingual dashboard (https://covid19kerala.info/) for nonspecialists. To ensure longevity and reusability, the dataset was deposited in an open-access public repository for future analysis. Finally, we provide outbreak trends and demographic characteristics of the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala during the first 138 days of the outbreak.<bold>Discussion: </bold>We anticipate that our dataset can form the basis for future studies, supplemented with clinical and epidemiological data from the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>We reported a citizen science initiative on the COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala to collect and deposit data in a structured format, which was utilized for visualizing the outbreak trend and describing demographic characteristics of affected individuals.",

The adoption of learning management systems results in a large amount of data that can be collected, processed and utilised to improve the students' learning experiences. This research examines the potential applications of analytics techniques for extracting insights from student-generated content in an academic setting. It showcases how different text analytics techniques, from descriptive content analysis, semantic network analysis, to topic modelling support the discovery of new insights from unstructured, user-generated data. We looked at 968 letters written by 'at risk' students in an Australian-based university in Southeast Asia to examine the difficulties the students faced, which led to their academic failure. The results show that time management, family, learning, assessment, and subjects were the leading causes of poor performance, but in a more nuanced way than was expected. Students often faced multiple challenges, one led to another, which resulted in the failing grades. Our study contributes a set of effective text analytics techniques for extracting insights from student data, providing the preliminary guidelines for an information system to detect early at risk students.",

First, co-occurrence data representing collaborations among nations were extracted from author affiliations. Second, the descriptive statistics, network indicators of collaborations, and research communities were calculated. Third, topological network maps, geographical maps integrated with topological network projections, and proportional maps were produced for visualization.Findings The results show that the scope of international collaborations in Big Data research is broad, but the distribution among nations is unbalanced and fragmented. The USA, China, and the UK were identified as the major contributors to this research area. Five research communities are identified, led by the USA, China, Italy, South Korea, and Brazil. Collaborations within each community vary, reflecting different levels of research development. The visualizations show that nations advance in Big Data research are centralized in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.Originality/value This study applied various informetric methods and tools to reveal the collaboration structure and patterns among nations in Big Data research.

        "Abstract": "Studies on the state and structure of digital knowledge concerning science generally relate to macro and meso scales. Supported by visualizations, these studies can deliver knowledge about emerging scientific fields or collaboration between countries, scientific centers, or groups of researchers. Analyses of individual activities or single scientific career paths are rarely presented and discussed. The authors decided to fill this gap and developed a web application for visualizing the scientific output of particular researchers. This free software based on bibliographic data from local databases, provides six layouts for analysis. Researchers can see the dynamic characteristics of their own writing activity, the time and place of publication, and the thematic scope of research problems. They can also identify cooperation networks, and consequently, study the dependencies and regularities in their own scientific activity. The current article presents the results of a study of the application's usability and functionality as well as attempts to define different user groups. A survey about the interface was sent to select researchers employed at Nicolaus Copernicus University. The results were used to answer the question as to whether such a specialized visualization tool can significantly augment the individual information space of the contemporary researcher.",

        "Abstract": "Social media and the data it produces lend itself to being visualised as a network. Individual Twitter users can be represented as nodes and retweeted by another Twitter user, thereby forming a relationship, an edge, between users. However, an unbounded network is a sprawling mass of nodes and edges. Boundary settings are typically applied, for example, a time period, a hashtag, a keyword search or a network substructure of a phenomenon of interest. Thus, the particular visualisation created is dependent upon the boundaries applied, enabling productive visual consumption, but concealing its social shaping. To explore this question of boundary setting and its associated issues, we draw on an example from the Twitter discussions about the UK Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, and the media debate surrounding the contractual hours of junior doctors during 2015\u20132016. We discuss the role and impact differing stakeholders have in setting these boundaries. We seek to provide a set of 'questioning lenses' in which we ask why these boundary settings were selected, what effect they have, and what are the potential implications of these boundary setting techniques on the visualisation consumer.",

        "Abstract": "Widely used across disciplines such as natural resources, social sciences, public health, humanities, and economics, spatial data is an important component in many studies and has promoted interdisciplinary research development. Though an institutional data repository provides a great solution for data curation, preservation, and sharing, it usually lacks the spatial visualization capability, which limits the use of spatial data to professionals. To increase the impact of research-generated spatial data and truly turn them into digital maps for a broader user base, we have designed and developed the workflow and cyberinfrastructure to extend the current capability of our institutional data repository by visualizing the spatial data on the web. In this project, we added a GIS server to the original institutional data repository cyberinfrastructure, which enables web map services. Then, through a web mapping API, we visualized the spatial data as an interactive web map and embedded in the data repository web page. From the user's perspective, researchers can still identify, cite and reuse the dataset by downloading the data and metadata and the DOI offered by the data repository. General information users can also browse the web maps to find location-based information. In addition, these data was ingested into the spatial data portal to increase the discoverability for spatial information users. Initial usage statistics suggest that this cyberinfrastructure has greatly improved the spatial data usage and extended the institutional data repository to facilitate spatial data sharing.",

Partnering with Australian Red Cross, this paper develops a mixed methodology for using Instagram data to identify and understand individuals' everyday humanitarian activity in a major urban centre (Melbourne, Australia) outside of the temporal frame of crisis. The research integrates hashtag data collection with thematic analysis in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to use visualise the links between types of humanitarian action, their motivations and contextual situations to precise urban locations. These attributes of Instagram posting practices offer a base layer of information about disparate prosocial action taking place in an urban context. We see this as informing and sustaining a new hybrid mode of promotional and humanitarian communication, evidencing social good 'place making' and enabling new forms of visible humanitarian participation.",

Design/methodology/approach: A set of evaluative aspects grouped into three analysis dimensions was established: collections, tools\u2014technologies and standards used\u2014and web user interface. As the object of the study, four projects of diverse nature and volume were selected to help provide a better understanding of the trends in the solutions provided for the end user when accessing linked data collections. Findings: Publishing LOD through visual interfaces maximises information enrichment, contextualisation and discovery, in addition to improving user experience, because of both increased navigation capabilities and interrelationships between data. These more flexible environments have metamorphosised the visualisation of bibliographic information. However, aspects that needed improvement were observed, primarily relating to (1) a more intuitive interaction, (2) possibilities of greater personalisation, (3) enhanced communication with the user to favour user engagement and (4) experimental spaces of data reuse. Research limitations/implications: Further quantitative and qualitative studies should be conducted to improve these portals, assess their adaptation to the behaviour of the user and their influence on the use of library collections. Originality/value: This article investigates the potential of semantic technologies in bibliographic data portals, proposes a methodological model for their evaluation and advances conclusions about the usability and user experience that these platforms provide, compared to classic catalogues.",

        "Abstract": "An increasing number of journals and publishers have data-sharing policies and data availability statements. This study examines data-sharing policies of faulty affiliated in medicine. More so, it addresses the following research questions: (1) What are the data-sharing policies of these research journals, (2) What is the relationship between data sharing, open access and journal impactor? and (3) What are current journal articles' applicability to Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Sharing Principles. The data identified and examined in this study are retrieved from a visualization tool detailing authors, coauthors, articles, number of citations, grants that used visualization mapping to indicate the impact of research groups. This results in an analysis of sixty articles. Twenty-three percent of the journals have no research data policy, seventeen percent have strong data policies and sixty percent have policies that encourage research data sharing. Seventy-two percent of the journals are open access. All the articles are Findable, and a majority are accessible. There were challenges accessing articles' applicability to Interoperability and the results of reusability were inconclusive. Overall, data-sharing policies vary, no correlation between high impact factor and research data policies. Publishers with supportive data-sharing statements and journals with no policies create complexities in interpretation and application of data sharing. FAIR Sharing has mostly been implemented in the context of curated data more research is needed in its applicability to article data.",

        "Abstract": "The numbers of online purchases and electronic banking transactions have increased substantially in the era of electronic business and mobile commerce. These online financial activities have attracted a special web threat called \"phishing\" that targets Internet users by seeking their credentials in order to access their financial information. Phishing involves impersonating a legitimate website by creating a visually similar fake website to deceive users. In the last decade different solutions to fight phishing that are primarily based on educating users, user's experience, search methods, machine learning and features similarity have been developed. This paper combines computational intelligence along with user's experience approaches to develop an anti-phishing visualisation method. Our method employs effective features chosen following thorough analysis on features scores generated by Correlation Feature Set and Information Gain processing techniques. We validate our anti-phishing features using classification systems produced by rule induction data mining approach. False positives, false negatives and phishing detection rate are the basis of evaluating the classification systems to measure our anti-phishing methods features' integrity.",

        "Abstract": "Acquiring an overview of an unfamiliar discipline and exploring relevant papers and journals is often a laborious task for researchers. In this paper we show how exploratory search can be supported on a large collection of academic papers to allow users to answer complex scientometric questions which traditional retrieval approaches do not support optimally. We use our ConceptCloud browser, which makes use of a combination of concept lattices and tag clouds, to visually present academic publication data (specifically, the ACM Digital Library) in a browsable format that facilitates exploratory search. We augment this dataset with semantic categories, obtained through automatic keyphrase extraction from papers' titles and abstracts, in order to provide the user with uniform keyphrases of the underlying data collection. We use the citations and references of papers to provide additional mechanisms for exploring relevant research by presenting aggregated reference and citation data not only for a single paper but also across topics, authors and journals, which is novel in our approach. We conduct a user study to evaluate our approach in which we asked 34 participants, from different academic backgrounds with varying degrees of research experience, to answer a variety of scientometric questions using our ConceptCloud browser. Participants were able to answer complex scientometric questions using our ConceptCloud browser with a mean correctness of 73%, with the user's prior research experience having no statistically significant effect on the results.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how scholars in the digital humanities employ information visualization techniques in their research, and how academic librarians should prepare themselves to support this emerging trend. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a content analysis methodology, which further draws techniques from data mining, natural language processing and information visualization to analyze three peer-reviewed journals published within the last five years and ten online university library research guides in this field. Findings: To successfully support and effectively contribute to the digital humanities, academic librarians should be knowledgeable in more than just visualization concepts and tools. The content analysis results for the digital humanities journals reflect the importance of recognizing the wide variety of applications and purposes of information visualization in digital humanities research. Practical implications: This study provides useful and actionable insights into how academic librarians can prepare for this emerging technology to support future endeavors in the digital humanities. Originality/value: Although information visualization has been widely adopted in digital humanities research, it remains unclear how librarians, especially academic librarians who support digital humanities research, should prepare for this emerging technology. This research is the first study to address this research gap through the lens of actual applications of information visualization techniques in digital humanities research, which is compared against university LibGuides for digital humanities research.",

The survey made use of the Leadership Competencies Model developed for the Library Leadership and Management Association (LLAMA). The results draw attention to a subset of competencies and expose perceptual differences between librarians at different leadership levels. By visualizing the data in a quadrant view, creating a leadership competency profile, the method can shed light on significant areas in leadership capabilities and trigger discussion among librarians on their understanding and assumptions about these attributes. The survey demonstrated a method that can be experimented by libraries and consortia beyond the Hong Kong sample. Such effort should eventually lead to constructive development strategies.",

Overlaid are HITS metrics that show the impact and transformativeness of different scientific subdisciplines. Both maps support the same interactivity, including search, filter, zoom, panning, and\u00a0details on demand. Users performed memorization, search, and retrieval tasks using both maps.

Given the rapid growth of COVID-19 clinical trials, there is an urgent need for a better clinical trial information retrieval that supports searching by specifying criteria including both eligibility criteria and structured trial information.<bold>Materials and Methods: </bold>We built a linked graph for registered COVID-19 clinical trials: the COVID-19 Trial Graph, to facilitate retrieval of clinical trials. Natural language processing (NLP) tools were leveraged to extract and normalize the clinical trial information from both their eligibility criteria free texts and structured information from ClinicalTrials.gov. We linked the extracted data using the COVID-19 Trial Graph and imported it to a graph database, which supports both query and visualization. We evaluated trial graph using case queries and graph embedding.<bold>Results: </bold>The graph currently (as of 10-05-2020) contains 3,392 registered COVID-19 clinical trials, with 17,480 nodes and 65,236 relationships. Manual evaluation of case queries found high-precision and recall scores on retrieving relevant clinical trials searching from both eligibility criteria and trial-structured information. We observed clustering in clinical trials via graph embedding, which also showed superiority over the baseline (0.8704 vs. 0.8199) in evaluating whether a trial can complete its recruitment successfully.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The COVID-19 Trial Graph is a novel representation of clinical trials that allows diverse search queries and provides a graph-based visualization of COVID-19 clinical trials. High-dimensional vectors mapped by graph embedding for clinical trials would be potentially beneficial for many downstream applications, such as trial end recruitment status prediction, and trial similarity comparison. Our methodology also is generalizable to other clinical trials, such as cancer clinical trials.",

Journalists often include a social media dimension in their stories but lack the tools to get digital photos of the virtual crowds about which they write. NodeXL is an easy to use tool for collecting, analysing, visualising and reporting on the patterns found in collections of connections in streams of social media. With a network map patterns emerge that highlight key people, groups, divisions and bridges, themes and related resources.Design/methodology/approach This study conducts a literature review of previous empirical work which has utilised NodeXL and highlights the potential of NodeXL to provide network insights of virtual crowds during emerging news events. It then develops a number of guidelines which can be utilised by news media teams to measure and map information diffusion during emerging news events.Findings One emergent software application known as NodeXL has allowed journalists to take \"group photos\" of the connections among a group of users on social media. It was found that a diverse range of disciplines utilise NodeXL in academic research. Furthermore, based on the features of NodeXL, a number of guidelines were developed which provide insight into how to measure and map emerging news events on Twitter.Social implications With a set of social media network images a journalist can cover a set of social media content streams and quickly grasp \"situational awareness\" of the shape of the crowd. Since social media popular support is often cited but not documented, NodeXL social media network maps can help journalists quickly document the social landscape utilising an innovative approach.Originality/value This is the first empirical study to review literature on NodeXL, and to provide insight into the value of network visualisations and analytics for the news media domain. Moreover, it is the first empirical study to develop guidelines that will act as a valuable resource for newsrooms looking to acquire insight into emerging news events from the stream of social media posts. In the era of fake news and automated accounts, i.e., bots the ability to highlight opinion leaders and ascertain their allegiances will be of importance in today's news climate.",

        "Abstract": "Since their beginnings, bibliographic information systems have been displaying results in the form of long, textual lists. With the development of new data models and computer technologies, the need for new approaches to present and interact with bibliographic data has slowly been maturing. To investigate how this could be accomplished, a prototype system, FrbrVis1, was designed to present work families within a bibliographic information system using information visualization. This paper reports on two user studies, a controlled and an observational experiment, that have been carried out to assess the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)-based against an existing system as well as to test four different hierarchical visual layouts. The results clearly show that FrbrVis offers better performance and user experience compared to the baseline system. The differences between the four hierarchical visualizations (Indented tree, Radial tree, Circlepack, and Sunburst) were, on the other hand, not as pronounced, but the Indented tree and Sunburst design proved to be the most successful, both in performance as well as user perception. The paper therefore not only evaluates the application of a visual presentation of bibliographic work families, but also provides valuable results regarding the performance and user acceptance of individual hierarchical visualization techniques.",

        "Abstract": "Highlights \u2022 How visual stimuli triggered IE on micro-blogging services was studied. \u2022 Micro-blogging services were IE-friendly environments and rich in visual stimuli. \u2022 Excluding text from visual stimuli increased users' interactions with micro-posts. \u2022 Higher comprehensibility or humorousness of visual stimuli increased users' interactions with micro-posts. \u2022 Applying CIT in diaries was effective for data collection in IE research. Abstract Despite various models established to present the process of information encountering (IE), little research has been done on the stimulus that plays an essential role in attracting users' attention and eliciting the subsequent behavioral responses during an IE process. This study was particularly interested in visual stimuli which are superior to textual ones in enhancing information processing and sensory experience. A diary study of IE was conducted in the context of micro-blogging services. They demonstrate the environmental characteristics conducive to IE and are especially abundant in visual stimuli. A total of 189 valid IE incidents triggered by visual stimuli on a representative micro-blogging service were collected with an online questionnaire created based on the critical incident technique (CIT) and analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. As found in this study, most of the visual stimuli triggering IE excluded text or motion, and their comprehensibility and novelty were both perceived to be high while humorousness much lower. The encountered micro-posts covered a wide range of topics and were published by different types of micro-bloggers. When interacting with the posts, the participants sometimes just examined their visual or textual content, but sometimes further captured the posts by liking, reposting, commenting, and following, etc. The significant results indicate that the visual stimuli excluding text and those with higher comprehensibility or humorousness were more likely to induce intense approach to the micro-posts. These findings inform micro-bloggers of the means of engaging the audience in intense interactions with their posts to gain persistent profit or reputation. The combination of diaries and the CIT is effective for data collection in IE research.",

        "Abstract": "This paper argues that visualisation conventions work to make the data represented within visualisations seem objective, that is, transparent and factual. Interrogating the work that visualisation conventions do helps us to make sense of the apparent contradiction between criticisms of visualisations as doing persuasive work and visualisation designers\u2019 belief that through visualisation, it is possible to \u2018do good with data\u2019 [Periscopic. 2014.Home page. Retrieved fromhttp://www.periscopic.com/]. We focus on four conventions which imbue visualisations with a sense of objectivity, transparency and facticity. These include: (a) two-dimensional viewpoints; (b) clean layouts; (c) geometric shapes and lines; (d) the inclusion of data sources. We argue that thinking about visualisations from a social semiotic standpoint, as we do in this paper by bringing together what visualisation designers say about their intentions with a semiotic analysis of the visualisations they produce, advances understanding of the ways that data visualisations come into being, how they are imbued with particular qualities and how power operates in and through them. Thus, this paper contributes nuanced understanding of data visualisations and their production, by uncovering the ways in which power is at work within them. In turn, it advances debate about data in society and the emerging field of data studies.",

It remains an open research question how this type of information should be presented for visual exploration. To get a sense of how users work with different types of visualisations, we evaluate a matrix and a node-link diagram in a controlled thinking aloud study. We describe the sense-making strategies that users adopted during explorative and realistic tasks. Thereby, we focus on the user behaviour in switching between the two visualisations and propose a set of nine strategies. Based on a qualitative and quantitative content analysis we show which visualisation supports which strategy better. We find that the two visualisations clearly support intelligence tasks and that for some tasks the combined use is more advantageous than the use of an individual visualisation.",

        "Abstract": "In the last years, many government organizations have implemented Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives. The data published describe a broad set of areas, including environment, budget and education among others. While these initiatives often report anecdotal success regarding improved efficiency and governmental savings, the potential applications of OGD remain a largely uncharted territory. In this paper, we claim that there is an important group of people interested in OGD -e.g., journalists and activists- who could benefit from the use of OGD, but who cannot do so because they cannot perform the essential operations needed to collect, process, merge, and make sense of the data. The reasons behind these problems are multiple, the most critical one being a fundamental lack of expertise and technical knowledge related to data management and visualizations. We propose the use of visualizations as a way to alleviate this situation. Visualizations provide a simple mechanism to understand and communicate large amounts of data. We also show evidence that there is a need for exploratory mechanisms to navigate the data and metadata in these visualizations. Finally, we provide a discussion on a set of features that tools should have in order to facilitate the creation of visualizations by users. We briefly present the implementation of these features in a new tool prototype focused on simplifying the creation of visualization based on Open Data.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract One of the most important opinion mining research directions falls in the extraction of polarities referring to specific entities (aspects) contained in the analyzed texts. The detection of such aspects may be very critical especially when documents come from unknown domains. Indeed, while in some contexts it is possible to train domain-specific models for improving the effectiveness of aspects extraction algorithms, in others the most suitable solution is to apply unsupervised techniques by making such algorithms domain-independent and more efficient in a real-time environment. Moreover, an emerging need is to exploit the results of aspect-based analysis for triggering actions based on these data. This led to the necessity of providing solutions supporting both an effective analysis of user-generated content and an efficient and intuitive way of visualizing collected data. In this work, we implemented an opinion monitoring service implementing (i) a set of unsupervised strategies for aspect-based opinion mining together with (ii) a monitoring tool supporting users in visualizing analyzed data. The aspect extraction strategies are based on the use of an open information extraction strategy. The effectiveness of the platform has been tested on benchmarks provided by the SemEval campaign and have been compared with the results obtained by domain-adapted techniques.",

        "Abstract": "The concept of the data structure is part of the accepted and relatively unexplored background of the information disciplines. As such, the data structure is treated largely as a technological artefact, helping to support but somewhat isolated from considerations of institutional order. This paper develops an alternative consideration of the data structure which focuses upon the constitutive capacity of such artefacts within institutional order. This viewpoint builds upon literature from the language/action tradition, the more recent work of John Searle on social ontology as well as the small amount of work which proposes the actability of data structures. To help provide some grip on the slippery notion of institutional order we consider it here in terms of the notion of business patterns. The term business pattern is used to refer to a coherent and repeating sequence of action involving humans, machines (including IT systems) and other artefacts (such as data structures) appropriate to some way of organising. The paper also describes a way of visualising either existing business patterns or envisaged business patterns through the pattern \u2018language\u2019 of pattern comics. We ground our approach using material gathered within a research study of a key routine enacted within a large manufacturing organisation. Within this routine a mismatch was experienced between what the data structures within the production IT system was telling production managers and what was experienced on the ground by production operators. We show how an actability worldview of data structures expressed in terms of business patterns offers a fruitful way of making sense of problem situations such as this. It also suggests important ways of thinking differently about the nature of design in relation to data structures.",

Our novel conceptual framework illustrates the implicit logic underlying OGD activities in the health domain and their anticipated impact on population health. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 50 diverse practitioners and policymakers from local, state, and federal agencies, and non-governmental organizations. Using a positive deviance approach, we identified innovative U.S. health agencies that were early OGD adopters. We analyzed transcripts using a grounded theory methodological approach to identify common themes. Results indicate that the OGD movement is marked by three major eras (pre-OGD early activities, Open Data 1.0, and Open Data 2.0), and U.S. health agencies are in different stages of evolution. Among innovative jurisdictions, OGD transitioned from an early focus on releasing large volumes of data to a more demand-driven approach to promote meaningful user engagement with data. Although engagement strategies could yield benefits, limited evidence exists on best practices for engaging diverse data users and many jurisdictions have not yet transitioned to this later phase. Our conceptual framework could be adapted for other domains to help visualize how successful OGD initiatives might unfold.",

To predict and anticipate the future issue patterns such as what kind of books might be in demand more or what is the taste of majority of users, can only be found by mining the information from the data of library. The library circulation data does not indicate much about the relationship between the users based on the books got issued by them. The aim of this paper is to develop communities based on the issue patterns and find how many similar users are there and which type of books a particular group of users prefer to read. So, the idea is to form a community-based on relationships among the library users and books and visualise the generated relationship through a graph to present the extracted information from the database more effectively. This is possible by finding the hidden relationships in data through community mining process, which has been done by identifying the relationship of users from library circulation data.",

A long-standing debate on the merits of photorealism versus non-photorealism in archaeological visualization provides an educating example of such a \"problematic\" or in Haraway's words, monstrous social information technology. This article shows how a closer look at the perceived monstrosities of social information technologies can help us understand how people conceptualize information, technologies, and other people and their role in information interactions as they unfold as part of information work. It shows how a lifelike photorealistic visualization together with its spectator forms a cyborg, which is a monstrous runaway \"object\" when it drives with its own cultural force a programme that contradicts with other programmes considered important. The parallels in the critiques of archaeological visualizations and other informational cyborgs in information research \u2013 including search engines, information systems and services \u2013 suggest usefulness of a monstrous perspective in the analysis of social information technologies in general.",

Using race, ethnicity, gender, and social vulnerability, we are able to measure and reflect our vaccine administration performance against the communities that we serve. With our visualization tools, stakeholders have been able to target interventions to improve equity in vaccine administrations, including improvements in race, ethnicity, and social vulnerability. We plan to use the data elements incorporated in our electronic health record and data warehouse due to the COVID-19 pandemic to guide further population health efforts at decreasing disparities.",

        "Abstract": "The immense growth of MEDLINE coupled with the realization that a vast amount of biomedical knowledge is recorded in free-text format, has led to the appearance of a large number of literature mining techniques aiming to extract biomedical terms and their inter-relations from the scientific literature. Ontologies have been extensively utilized in the biomedical domain either as controlled vocabularies or to provide the framework for mapping relations between concepts in biology and medicine. Literature-based approaches and ontologies have been used in the past for the purpose of hypothesis generation in connection with drug discovery. Here, we review the application of literature mining and ontology modeling and traversal to the area of drug repurposing (DR). In recent years, DR has emerged as a noteworthy alternative to the traditional drug development process, in response to the decreased productivity of the biopharmaceutical industry. Thus, systematic approaches to DR have been developed, involving a variety of in silico, genomic and high-throughput screening technologies. Attempts to integrate literature mining with other types of data arising from the use of these technologies as well as visualization tools assisting in the discovery of novel associations between existing drugs and new indications will also be presented.",

        "Abstract": "Currently \"Big Data\" is an emerging field that presents several Information Technology challenges regarding the capture, storage search, structure, and visualization of this data. The real challenge for organizations is to find ways to extract value from it and provide better services to their clients. The data generated in academic and other institutions is vast and complex. Libraries face new challenges as they seek to determine their role in the handling of Big Data within their organization and use it to develop services. Thus, in most organizations, libraries will not have the knowledge to build new services unaided. Furthermore, libraries have always been information handlers and technology adopters; therefore, Big Data technologies will certainly affect their context. The purpose of this paper is to explore all these issues through a systematic literature review, unveiling the theories that underpin the paper's argument. It attempts to answer several research questions, such as how librarians are involved in the Big Data era? And what are the future research developments of Big Data within the library context? The study considered only papers published between 2012 and 2018 in English and presents the collected literature by grouping them according to the type of library each paper refers to. Thus, it identifies new and evolving roles in the context of all types of libraries. In addition, the study presents several interesting tables, which aim to help librarians locate relevant articles that will inform their practice and guide service development for users of large and complex datasets.",

After selecting performance indicators suitable for a CRC, we describe main properties of the data using visualization techniques. To study the relationship between the dimensions of research performance, we use a time fixed effects panel data model and fixed effects Poisson model. With the help of year dummy variables, we show how the pattern of research productivity changes over time after controlling for staff and travel costs. The joint depiction of the time fixed effects and the research project's life cycle allows a better understanding of the development of the number of discussion papers over time.",

A questionnaire survey was designed to ask the users\u2019 level of agreement or disagreement about the selected opinion visualisation techniques against a set of information visualisation metrics. The data were collected by conducting seminars and using a web-based online questionnaire. We categorised participants (N\u2009=\u2009146) into three age groups (\u226420 years: teenager; 21\u201330 years: young adults; >30: adults). According to domain knowledge, participants are classified into two groups, one having knowledge of human computer interaction (HCI users) and the other without this knowledge (non-HCI users). The collected data were analysed using an independent samplet-test and analysis of variance. It is concluded that there are significant differences between the perception of HCI and non-HCI users on visual appeal, understandability, user friendliness, intuitiveness, informativeness, usefulness, comprehensiveness, comparison ability, and pre-knowledge requirement. Moreover, age was found to be significant for visual appeal, comprehensiveness, intuitiveness, and pre-knowledge requirement.",

        "Abstract": "Collaborative Computer- Supported Argument Visualization ( CCSAV) has often been proposed as an alternative over more conventional, mainstream platforms for online discussion (e.g., online forums and wikis). CCSAV tools require users to contribute to the creation of a joint artifact (argument map) instead of contributing to a conversation. In this paper we assess empirically the effects of this fundamental design choice and show that the absence of conversational affordances and socially salient information in representation-centric tools is detrimental to the users' collaboration experience. We report empirical findings from a study in which subjects using different collaborative platforms (a forum, an argumentation platform, and a socially augmented argumentation tool) were asked to discuss and predict the price of a commodity. By comparing users' experience across several metrics we found evidence that the collaborative performance decreases gradually when we remove conversational interaction and other types of socially salient information. We interpret these findings through theories developed in conversational analysis (common ground theory) and communities of practice and discuss design implications. In particular, we propose balancing the trade-off between knowledge reification and participation in representation-centric tools with the provision of social feedback and functionalities supporting meaning negotiation.",

A primary phenotype was defined from actual patient profiles in the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II database. Network visualizations depicting primary relationships were compared to those incorporating secondary adjacencies. Interactivity was enabled through a phenotype visualization software concept: the Phenomics Advisor. Subendocardial infarction with cardiac arrest was demonstrated as a sample phenotype; there were 332 primarily adjacent diagnoses, with 5423 relationships. Primary network visualization suggested a treatment-related complication phenotype and several rare diagnoses; re-clustering by secondary relationships revealed an emergent cluster of smokers with the metabolic syndrome. Network visualization reveals phenotypic patterns that may have remained occult in pairwise correlation analysis. Visualization of complex data, potentially offered as point-of-care tools on mobile devices, may allow clinicians and researchers to quickly generate hypotheses and gain deeper understanding of patient subpopulations.",

Analyzing the scientific papers of a university under the bibliometric approach is one main evaluative approach. The aim of this study was to conduct a bibliometric analysis and visualization of papers published by Hamadan University of Medical Science (HUMS), Iran, during 1992-2018. This study used bibliometric and visualization techniques. Scopus database was used for data collection. 3753 papers were retrieved by applying Affiliation Search in Scopus advanced search section. Excel and VOSviewer software packages were used for data analysis and bibliometric indicator extraction. An increasing trend was seen in the numbers of HUMS's published papers and received citations. The highest rate of collaboration in national level was with Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Internationally, HUMS's researchers had the highest collaboration with the authors from the United States, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, respectively. All highly-cited papers were published in high level Q1 journals. Term clustering demonstrated four main clusters: epidemiological studies, laboratory studies, pharmacological studies, and microbiological studies. The results of this study can be beneficial to the policy-makers of this university. In addition, researchers and bibliometricians can use this study as a pattern for studying and visualizing the bibliometric indicators of other universities and research institutions.",

        "Abstract": "Large-scale distributed digital library systems with aggregated metadata provide platforms for resource discovery and retrieval. For researchers, aggregated metadata offers a potential for big data analysis and exploration of digital knowledge growth. The paper reports the findings of the study that investigated the distribution of the date elements in the metadata aggregated in the Polish Federation of Digital Libraries and related it to the types of libraries. The purpose of this study was to address the gap in research about heterogeneous digital libraries and explore the dynamics of their growth. The authors included timeline characteristics of the development of Polish digital libraries and proposed a new dynamics parameter \u2013 resource release interval. They used histograms, which have been grouped according to the organizational and thematic criteria, developed for this study. All charts are characterized by two similar maximum points. Their shapes and ratio have been analysed by both statistical and visual methods. The shape of resource release interval charts revealed characteristic differences for libraries types. The proposed approach, based on time characteristics, is an important step in the development of systematic classification of digital libraries and digitizing institutions. It can be also considered as a new tool in monitoring the dynamics of digital knowledge growth.",

        "Abstract": "To this day, data-driven science is a widely accepted concept in the digital library (DL) context (Hey et al. in The fourth paradigm: data-intensive scientific discovery. Microsoft Research, ). In the same way, domain knowledge from information visualization, visual analytics, and exploratory search has found its way into the DL workflow. This trend is expected to continue, considering future DL challenges such as content-based access to new document types, visual search, and exploration for information landscapes, or big data in general. To cope with these challenges, DL actors need to collaborate with external specialists from different domains to complement each other and succeed in given tasks such as making research data publicly available. Through these interdisciplinary approaches, the DL ecosystem may contribute to applications focused on data-driven science and digital scholarship. In this work, we present VisInfo () , a web-based digital library system (DLS) with the goal to provide visual access to time series research data. Based on an exploratory search (ES) concept (White and Roth in Synth Lect Inf Concepts Retr Serv 1(1):1-98, ), VisInfo at first provides a content-based overview visualization of large amounts of time series research data. Further, the system enables the user to define visual queries by example or by sketch. Finally, VisInfo presents visual-interactive capability for the exploration of search results. The development process of VisInfo was based on the user-centered design principle. Experts from computer science, a scientific digital library, usability engineering, and scientists from the earth, and environmental sciences were involved in an interdisciplinary approach. We report on comprehensive user studies in the requirement analysis phase based on paper prototyping, user interviews, screen casts, and user questionnaires. Heuristic evaluations and two usability testing rounds were applied during the system implementation and the deployment phase and certify measurable improvements for our DLS. Based on the lessons learned in VisInfo, we suggest a generalized project workflow that may be applied in related, prospective approaches.",

Urban planning and morphology have relied on analytical cartography and visual communication tools for centuries to illustrate spatial patterns, conceptualize proposed designs, compare alternatives, and engage the public. Classic urban form visualizations \u2013 from Giambattista Nolli's ichnographic maps of Rome to Allan Jacobs's figure-ground diagrams of city streets \u2013 have compressed physical urban complexity into easily comprehensible information artifacts. Today we can enhance these traditional workflows through the Smart Cities paradigm of understanding cities via user-generated content and harvested data in an information management context. New spatial technology platforms and big data offer new lenses to understand, evaluate, monitor, and manage urban form and evolution. This paper builds on the theoretical framework of visual cultures in urban planning and morphology to introduce and situate computational data science processes for exploring urban fabric patterns and spatial order. It demonstrates these workflows with OSMnx and data from OpenStreetMap, a collaborative spatial information system and mapping platform, to examine street network patterns, orientations, and configurations in different study sites around the world, considering what these reveal about the urban fabric. The age of ubiquitous urban data and computational toolkits opens up a new era of worldwide urban form analysis from integrated quantitative and qualitative perspectives.",

        "Abstract": "Objectives - This project had two stated objectives: 1) to compare the location and concentration of Saskatchewan-based large ensembles (bands, orchestras, choirs) within the province, with the intention to draw conclusions about the history of community-based musical activity within the province; and 2) to enable location-based browsing of Saskatchewan music materials through an interactive search interface. Methods - Data was harvested from MARC metadata found in the library catalogue for a special collection of Saskatchewan music at the University of Saskatchewan. Microsoft Excel and OpenRefine were used to screen, clean, and enhance the dataset. Data was imported into ArcGIS software, where it was plotted using a geo-visualization showing location and concentrations of musical activity by large ensembles within the province. The geo-visualization also allows users to filter results based on the ensemble type (band, orchestra, or choir). Results - The geo-visualization shows that albums from large community ensembles appear across the province, in cities and towns of all sizes. The ensembles are concentrated in the southern portion of the province and there is a correlation between population density and ensemble location. Choral ensembles are more prevalent than bands and orchestras, and appear more widely across the province, whereas bands and orchestras are concentrated around larger centres. Conclusions - Library catalogue data contains unique information for research based on special collections, though additional cleaning is needed. Using geospatial visualizations to navigate collections allows for more intuitive searching by location, and allow users to compare facets. While not appropriate for all kinds of searching, maps are useful for browsing and for locationbased searches. Information is displayed in a visual way that allows users to explore and connect with other platforms for more information.",

Twitter has become an important virtual venue where global users hold conversations, share information, and exchange news and research. This study investigates social network structures among Twitter users with regard to the Covid-19 outbreak at its onset and its spread. The data were derived from two Twitter datasets by using a search query, \"coronavirus,\" on February 28th, 2020, when the coronavirus outbreak was at a relatively early stage. The first dataset is a collection of tweets used in investigating social network structures and for visualization. The second dataset comprises tweets that have citations of scientific research publications regarding coronavirus. The collected data were analyzed to examine numerical indicators of the social network structures, subgroups, influencers, and features regarding research citations. This was also essential to measure the statistical relationships among social elements and research citations. The findings revealed that individuals tend to have conversations with specific people in clusters regarding daily issues on coronavirus without prominent or central voice tweeters. Tweets related to coronavirus were often associated with entertainment, politics, North Korea, and business. During their conversations, the users also responded to and mentioned the U.S. president, the World Health Organization (WHO), celebrities, and news channels. Meanwhile, people shared research articles about the outbreak, including its spread, symptoms related to the disease, and prevention strategies. These findings provide insight into the information sharing behaviors at the onset of the outbreak.",

But, with the replication crisis facing many business disciplines, there is a need for business librarians to offer more data sharing and general data management support to their researchers. To find evidence of this data need, 146 business journal's data sharing policies were reviewed and analyzed to uncover meaningful trends in business research. Results of the study indicate data sharing is not mandated by business journals. However, data sharing is often encouraged and recommended. This journal policy content analysis provides evidence that business researchers have opportunities to share their research data, and with the right data management support, business librarians can play a significant role in improving the data sharing behaviors of business researchers.",

The objective is to inform health librarians about the nature and magnitude of the technological innovations in health information analysis tools, its influence, and where and how further material could be searched. Methods: We performed a bibliometric and co\u2010citation analysis within a total of 804 papers published between 2000 and 2016 and retrieved from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Using the NVivo text analysis software, we identified the stakeholders of BDA in health and innovative decision support systems in the field. Results: Our findings show a tremendous increase in published papers after 2014. Most of them are relevant to neurology and medical oncology. The stakeholders are clinicians, researchers, patients, administrators, IT specialists, vendors and policymakers. New BDA tools in medicine are mostly developed for disease monitoring purposes while they utilise visualisation to identify disease patterns and statistical analysis of past data for making predictions. Conclusions: Health analytics provide a unique opportunity for advancing health information research and medical decision making. It provides health information professionals with new tools in problem\u2010solving offering new perspectives in prognosis and diagnosis of diseases.",

The authors\u2019 approach based on MDS was enriched by algorithm mapping to spherical topology. Three other methods were based on VOS, VxOrd and SOM mapping techniques. Visualization of the classified collection was done for three different decades. Tracking the changes in visualization patterns, the authors sought the method that would reveal the real evolution of the CCS scheme, which is still being updated by the editorial board. Comparative analysis is based on qualitative methods. Changes in those properties over two decades were evaluated for the benefit of the authors\u2019 method of mapping. The qualitative analysis shows clustering of proper categories and overlapping of other ones in the authors\u2019 approach, which corresponds to the current changes in the classification scheme and computer science literature.",

As a remedy, we have built an open-source project and we have been operating an open service that detects flu-related symptoms and shares the data in real-time with anyone who wants to built upon this system. An analysis of a small number of precisely geo-located status updates (e.g. Twitter) correlates closely with the Google Flu Trends and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention flu-positive reports. We suggest that public health information systems should embrace an open-source approach and offer linked data, in order to facilitate the development of an ecosystem of applications and services, and in order to be transparent to the general public interest.",

        "Abstract": "Visual representations of data introduce several possible challenges for the human visual perception system in perceiving brightness levels. Overcoming these challenges might be simplified by adding sound to the representation. This is called sonification. As sonification provides additional information to the visual information, sonification could be useful in supporting the visual perception. In the present study, usefulness (in terms of accuracy and response time) of sonification was investigated with an interactive sonification test. In the test, participants were asked to identify the highest brightness level in a monochrome visual representation. The task was performed in four conditions, one with no sonification and three with different sonification settings. The results show that sonification is useful, as measured by higher task accuracy, and that the participant's musicality facilitates the use of sonification with better performance when sonification was used. The results were also supported by subjective measurements, where participants reported an experienced benefit of sonification.",

To that end, we have structured it in three main parts, the first of which is to show the importance of archival science as a political tool in the framework of the information society. The second part focuses on the path followed by the AAC from its first steps taken to preserve social web hashtags, in order to gain technical expertise, to the reflection on the theoretical background required to go beyond the mere collection of social web content that led us to the definition of a new type of archival fonds: the social fonds. Finally, the third part sets out the case study of #Cu\u00e9ntalo. Thanks to our previous experiences, this hashtag, created to denounce male violence, enabled us to design a more robust project that not only included the gathering and preservation of data but also a vast auto-categorisation exercise using a natural language processing algorithm that assisted in the design of a dynamic and startling data visualisation covering the 160,000 original tweets involved.",

        "Abstract": "By employing bibliometric method, this study aimed to visualize the research hotspots and correlations among clinical medicine subjects. Literatures were retrieved from the PubMed database based on MeSH words and free-text phrases and screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The disease themes were manually marked according to ICD-10. Co-word analysis and strategic diagram methods were applied to explore the hot topics and development trends of disease themes. 2551 articles were included after literature screening. The amount of paper showed an increasing trend and reached a peak in 2013. The subjects of adults and the elderly accounted for 45.0% and 27.0% respectively. The United States of America had the most publication, with Massachusetts and California being the most prevalent states, and Harvard University was the most prolific institution. Co-word analysis revealed that research hot topics of diseases were divided into 8 themes, among which the most was \"disease of the circulatory system\" and \"injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes\". The strategic diagram showed that the above two topics were mature but relatively independent, while the \"physical fitness\" topic was not mature enough but was closely related to the others. There are more and more data-driven studies in the field of medicine and health, while, huge development spaces in the full spectrum of the diseases do exist. Mining the published researches through bibliometrics and visualized methods could come up with valuable results to inform further study.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: This study examines research methods utilized in five practitioner-oriented research journals \u2013 College and Research Libraries, Information Technology and Libraries, Journal of the Medical Library Association, Library Resources and Technical Services and Reference and User Services Quarterly. The study fills gaps identified in existing content analyses of methods in practitioner-based LIS research publications. Design/methodology/approach: Based on analysis standards and coding schemes supplied by the studies of Kalervo Jarvelin and Pertti Vakkari, as well as Heting Chu, this study identifies the primary research method utilized in 6,387 articles published in these five journals from 1980 to 2019. Trends in the frequencies with which various research methods were used are identified and presented using a series of visualizations. Findings: Significant shifts have occurred in the research methods used by articles in these practitioner-based journals over the past four decades. Notably, the proportion of case studies has dropped substantially, particularly among College and Research Libraries and Journal of the Medical Library Association articles. Diversity of research methods utilized in articles has increased over time, with College and Research Libraries, in particular, having a significant proportion of articles in recent years that employ data analytic or qualitative approaches. Originality/value: While similar approaches have been used to examine research methods among other LIS journals, this study is the first to focus primarily on practitioner-based journals and document continuous change (as opposed to sampling a few years) over an extended, 40-year period.",

In this study, we developed an ontology of geological time scale by using a Resource Description Framework model to represent the ordinal hierarchical structure of the geological time scale and to encode collected annotations of geological time scale concepts. We also developed an animated graphical view of the developed ontology, and functions for interactions between the ontology, the animation and online geological maps published as layers of OGC Web Map Service. The featured functions include automatic annotations for geological time concepts recognized from a geological map, changing layouts in the animation to highlight a concept, showing legends of geological time contents in an online map with the animation, and filtering out and generalizing geological time features in an online map by operating the map legend shown in the animation. We set up a pilot system and carried out a user survey to test and evaluate the usability and usefulness of the developed ontology, animation and interactive functions. Results of the pilot system and the user survey demonstrate that our works enhance features of online geological map services and they are helpful for users to understand and to explore geological time contents and features, respectively, of a geological map.",

The availability of healthcare data has exponentially grown, both in quantity and complexity. The speed of this evolution has generated new challenges for translating complex data into effective evidence-informed policy. Visual analytics offers new capacity to analyze healthcare systems and support better decision-making. We conducted a systematic scoping review to look for evidence of visual analytics approaches being applied to mental healthcare systems and their use in driving policy. We found 79 relevant studies and categorized them in two ways: by study purpose and by type of visualization. The majority (67.1%) of the studies used geographical maps, and 11% conducted highly complex studies requiring novel visualizations. Significantly, only 15% of the studies provided information indicating high levels of usability for policy and planning. Our findings suggest that while visual analytics continues to evolve rapidly, there is a need to ensure this evolution reflects the practical needs of policy makers.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose Since researchers have utilized text signals to develop a mass of within-document visualization analysis tools for reading aid in a long document, there is an increasing need to study the relationship between readers\u2019 behavior of using text signals for navigation and their reading performance in the tools. The purpose of this paper is to combine the text signals using behavior and reading performance in two kinds of analysis tools to verify their relationship and discover whether there is any efficient reading strategy when using text signals to navigate a long document.Design/methodology/approach The methodology is a case study. The authors reviewed related literature first. After explaining the design ideas, interface and functions of THC-DAT and BOOKMARK, which are two reading tools utilizing two main kinds of text signals, one utilizing topics and the other utilizing headings for reading aid, a case study was presented to collect click data on the text signals of participants and their reading effectiveness (score) and efficiency (time).Findings The results confirm that the text signals using behavior for navigation has a significant impact on reading efficiency and no impact on reading effectiveness in both BOOKMARK and THC-DAT. The discrete degree of clicks behavior on text signals has an impact on reading efficiency. The using behavior of different types of text signals has different impacts on reading efficiency.Research limitations/implications Using text signals for navigation time evenly can help improve reading efficiency. And a basic strategy suggested to readers is focusing on reducing their time to find answers when using text signals for navigation in a long document. As to utilizing the two different kinds of text signals, readers can have different strategies. Accordingly, personalized recommendation based on interval of adjacent clicks will help to improve computer-aided reading tools.Originality/value This paper combines the text signals using behavior for navigation and reading performance in two kinds of visual analysis tools, studied the relationship between them and discovers some efficient reading strategies when using text signals for navigation to read a long document.",

At about the same time, the era of local storage in end-user equipment is about to give way to remote computing where data resides on third party equipment (cloud computing). Once information, and even the most personal one, is no longer stored on personal equipment the relationship between individual users and their digital assets belonging to them is becoming increasingly abstract. This contribution focuses on the implications of cloud computing for individuals' unpublicized digital records. The question to be answered is whether--taken together--the progressing virtualization and the disruption of physical control produce a backslide for individual positions of rights. The article introduces the legal treatment of users' digital personal records and how a technical transformation in combination with disparate legal protection and prevailing commercial practices are bound to impact the distribution of rights and obligations.",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Interpolating cubic splines: are interpolating functions (they pass through the given data points); are cubic, i.e. are polynomials of third degree; have first and second derivatives in the data points, implying that they connect data points in a smooth way; satisfy a best-approximation property which tends to reduce curvature. These properties are illustrated in the paper using real citation data. Findings \u2013 The paper reveals that calculating splines yields a differentiable function that still captures small but real changes. It offers a middle way between connecting discrete data by line segments and providing an overall best-fitting curve. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The major disadvantage of the use of splines is that accurate data are essential. Practical implications \u2013 Spline functions can be used for illustrative as well as modelling purposes.

However, this sector faces its own challenges, such as how to organise services to provide coordinated care given: their physical distribution, patients using multiple services, increased patient use and differing patient needs. The aim of this work was to explore, analyse and understand patterns in community referrals for patients aged 65 years and over, and their use of multiple services through data visualisation. Working with a large community provider, these methods helped researchers and service managers to investigate questions that were otherwise difficult to answer from raw data. Each map focuses on a different characteristic of community referrals: patients reusing services, concurrent uses of different services and patterns of subsequent referrals. We apply these methods to routine patient data and discuss their implications in designing of a single point of access \u2013 a service for streamlining referrals.",

Results reveal that information literacy has evolved from being a library- and/or librarianship-oriented concept to a multidisciplinary field and is no longer restricted to social sciences but is spread across 27 disciplines in Scopus' subject classification. New literacies have emerged after 2000 to include digital literacy, media literacy, health literacy, business information literacy, metaliteracy, content literacy, workplace information literacy, scientific literacy and science literacy. Library instruction remains a prominent method of information literacy delivery in academic libraries. We conclude that information literacy is dynamic and spread across many disciplines and would, therefore, require interdisciplinary and collaborative approaches for its effective delivery in what is turning out to be diverse and complex information and learning environments.",

        "Abstract": "The debate about which similarity measure one should use for the normalization in the case of Author Co-citation Analysis (ACA) is further complicated when one distinguishes between the symmetrical co-citation\u2014or, more generally, co-occurrence\u2014matrix and the underlying asymmetrical citation\u2014occurrence\u2014matrix. In the Web environment, the approach of retrieving original citation data is often not feasible. In that case, one should use the Jaccard index, but preferentially after adding the number of total citations (i.e., occurrences) on the main diagonal. Unlike Salton's cosine and the Pearson correlation, the Jaccard index abstracts from the shape of the distributions and focuses only on the intersection and the sum of the two sets. Since the correlations in the co-occurrence matrix may be spurious, this property of the Jaccard index can be considered as an advantage in this case.",

This is the ultimate goal of all the various processes and strategies created to meet the needs of people living together in communities. We propose a holistic integrated visualization, in the form of a community well-being assessment system, as a web-based advanced tool to be used by the executive and health officers of the sub-district administration organization (SAO) network to improve decision-making in order to strengthen their communities. Data were obtained from the Family and Community Assessment Program (FAP) and the SAO in nine sub-districts, covering all of the four regions of Thailand. The system incorporates dashboard architecture and assists the executive and health officers in the SAO to achieve better decision-making for the deployment of proper measures in communities. The model was developed for the Pakpoon SAO and was applied to the other eight SAOs. In order to evaluate the model, 243 users, covering all user groups from three sites, were asked to answer 18 questions during a meeting. The overall average score for user satisfaction was 4.12. The results indicate that this model can be used for community well-being assessment, in order to improve decision-making to strengthen communities in Thailand.",

        "Abstract": "Background: As digital healthcare expands to include the use of mobile devices, there are opportunities to integrate these technologies into the self-management of chronic disease. Purpose built apps for diabetes self-management are plentiful and vary in functionality; they offer capability for individuals to record, manage, display, and interpret their own data. The optimal incorporation of mobile tablets into diabetes self-care is little explored in research, and guidelines for use are scant. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine an individual's use of mobile devices and apps in the self-management of type 2 diabetes to establish the potential and value of this ubiquitous technology for chronic healthcare. Methods: In a 9-month intervention, 28 patients at a large multidisciplinary healthcare center were gifted internet connected Apple iPads with preinstalled apps and given digital support to use them. They were invited to take up predefined activities, which included recording their own biometrics, monitoring their diet, and traditional online information seeking. Four online surveys captured the participants' perceptions and health outcomes throughout the study. This article reports on the qualitative analysis of the open-ended responses in all four surveys. Results: Using apps, participants self-curated small data sets that included their blood glucose level, blood pressure, weight, and dietary intake. The dynamic visualizations of the data in the form of charts and diagrams were created using apps and participants were able to interpret the impact of their choices and behaviors from the diagrammatic form of their small personal data sets. Findings are presented in four themes: (1) recording personal data; (2) modelling and visualizing the data; (3) interpreting the data; and (4) empowering and improving health. Conclusions: The modelling capability of apps using small personal data sets, collected and curated by individuals, and the resultant graphical information that can be displayed on tablet screens proves a valuable asset for diabetes self-care. Informed by their own data, individuals are well-positioned to make changes in their daily lives that will improve their health.",

The full text of 1648 research articles from five peer-reviewed representative LIS journals in these two periods was analyzed by using LDA. A total of 30 topics in each period were labeled based on the frequency of terms and the contents of the articles. These topics were plotted on a two-dimensional map using LDAvis and categorized based on their location and characteristics in the plots. Although research areas in some forms were persistent with which discovered in previous studies, they were crucial to the transition of the knowledge structure in LIS and had the following three features: (1) The Internet became the premise of research in LIS in 2015\u20132017. (2) Theoretical approach or empirical work can be considered as a factor in the transition of the knowledge structure in some categories. (3) The topic diversity of the five core LIS journals decreased from the 2000\u20132002 to 2015\u20132017.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, the authors examine some of the implications of born-digital research environments by discussing the emergence of data mining and the analysis of social media platforms. With the rise of individual online activity in chat rooms, social networking sites and micro-blogging services, new repositories for social science research have become available in large quantities. Given the changes of scale that accompany such research, both in terms of data mining and the communication of results, the authors term this type of research \u2018massified research\u2019. This article argues that while the private and commercial processing of these new massive data sets is far from unproblematic, the use by academic practitioners poses particular challenges with respect to established ethical protocols. These involve reconfigurations of the external relations between researchers and participants, as well as the internal relations that compose the identities of the participant, the researcher and that of the data. Consequently, massified research and its outputs operate in a grey area of undefined conduct with respect to these concerns. The authors work through the specific case study of using Twitter's public Application Programming Interface for research and visualization. To conclude, this article proposes some potential best practices to extend current procedures and guidelines for such massified research. Most importantly, the authors develop these under the banner of \u2018agile ethics\u2019. The authors conclude by making the counterintuitive suggestion that researchers make themselves as vulnerable to potential data mining as the subjects who comprise their data sets: a parity of practice.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to contribute to the field of machine-pro cessable bibliographic data that is suitable for the Semantic Web. We examine the Entity Relationship (ER) model, which has been selected by IFLA as a \"conceptual framework\" in order to model the FR family (FRBR, FRAD, and RDA), and the problems ER causes as we move towards the Semantic Web. Subsequently, while maintaining the semantics of the aforementioned standards but rejecting the ER as a conceptual framework for bibliographic data, this paper builds on the RDF (Resource Description Framework) potential and documents how both the RDF and Linked Data's rationale can affect the way we model bibliographic data. In this way, a new approach to bibliographic data emerges where the distinction between description and authorities is obsolete. Instead, the integration of the authorities with descriptive information becomes fundamental so that a network of correlations can be established between the entities and the names by which the entities are known. Naming is a vital issue for human cultures because names are not random sequences of characters or sounds that stand just as identifiers for the entities--they also have socio-cultural meanings and interpretations. Thus, instead of describing indivisible resources, we could describe entities that appear in a variety of names on various resources. In this study, a method is proposed to connect the names with the entities they represent and, in this way, to document the provenance of these names by connecting specific resources with specific names.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose \u2013 Despite the importance of bibliographic information systems for discovering and exploring library resources, some of the core functionality that should be provided to support users in their information seeking process is still missing. Investigating these issues, the purpose of this paper is to design a solution that would fulfil the missing objectives. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Building on the concepts of a work family, functional requirements for bibliographic records (FRBR) and information visualization, the paper proposes a model and user interface design that could support a more efficient and user-friendly presentation and navigation in bibliographic information systems. Findings \u2013 The proposed design brings together all versions of a work, related works, and other works by and about the author and shows how the model was implemented into a FrbrVis prototype system using hierarchical visualization layout. Research limitations/implications \u2013 Although issues related to discovery and exploration apply to various material types, the research first focused on works of fiction and was also limited by the selected sample of records. Practical implications \u2013 The model for presenting and interacting with FRBR-based data can serve as a good starting point for future developments and implementations. Originality/value \u2013 With FRBR concepts being gradually integrated into cataloguing rules, formats, and various bibliographic services, one of the important questions that has not really been investigated and studied is how the new type of data would be presented to users in a way that would exploit the true potential of the changes.",

        "Abstract": "Visual representations of data have increasingly included color-encodings to help engage participants in health research. However, there is limited information on the way in which participants interpret color or on the influence of embedded cultural interpretations of color on survey responses. This study examines the interpretation of color-encodings used to indicate survey response options and their impact on participants' responses. Using a descriptive, cross-sectional design, interviews were conducted with 30 older Hmong adults from one Midwestern city in the United States. A survey data collection method was developed using: (a) an Audio-Computer-Assisted Self-Interviewing tool with (b) text-based and color-encoded response options and (c) assistance from a familiar helper. We analyzed the responses using directed content analysis. Findings reveal that some colors (red, black, and white) have strong cultural connotations; such colors were strongly correlated with specific emotions, while others (green, blue, purple, and pink) had no cultural meaning. Early in the survey, some older Hmong were distracted by response options indicated in red and black, influencing their response choices. However, with repeated instructions from the helpers, all participants overcame the color-related distractions and completed the survey. The findings highlight the importance of using colors cautiously and purposively in visualization development.",

This exploratory research study explores two popular physical computing platforms, oriented towards novice makers, that allow end-user developers to create and deploy an IoT smart home sensor device, as well as visualise the resulting data in the cloud. The end users' experiences are evaluated against known EUD design principles, finding that the platforms in their current state are only partially able to meet two of the principles. Such end-to-end IoT prototyping platforms are a relatively recent offering of these maker-focused organisations and, despite some issues in their current state, they offer the potential to increase the ability of end-users to prototype across the complex layers of an IoT system. Future possibilities around the data visualisation layer and for integration with visual programming work are identified, to improve the end-users' ability to deeply customise their IoT systems.",

Visualization tools were used to map the knowledge structure of library science. The findings indicate that, during the past 20 years, library science has developed into an interdisciplinary knowledge structure that integrates librarianship topics with a range of other fields, generating major topics that include the academic library, the digital library, research methodology, library marketing, information retrieval, digital information, document citation, and so on.

There is a growing trend for libraries to be cooperatively involved in the gathering and provision of research intelligence and impact data. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library has developed a system for generating research impact visualizations for research groups within the newly established Carle Illinois College of Medicine. Using the Elsevier Scopus database Applications Programming Interface, we have created a series of scripts to extract article, conference paper, and book chapter metadata and build supporting database tables. From the database, a dashboard visualization of scaled and clickable display bubbles and publication number labels is generated for each individual researcher. The interactive visualization can retrieve articles and papers published over the last five years, citation information (as cited by number) for each researcher, National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health grant matches, and a visualization of the coauthored papers for each author within the cohort. These activities enhance the role of the library in supporting knowledge management and scholarly communication and in fostering campus partnerships and collaborations.",

        "Abstract": "The landscape metaphor was one of the first methods used by the information visualization community to reorganize and depict document archives that are not inherently spatial. The motivation for the use of the landscape metaphor is that everyone intuitively understands landscapes. We critically examine the information visualization designer's ontologies for implementing spatialized landscapes with ontologies of the geographic domain held by lay people. In the second half of the article, we report on a qualitative study where we empirically assessed whether the landscape metaphor has explanatory power for users trying to make sense of spatialized views, and if so, in what ways. Specifically, we are interested in uncovering how lay people interpret hills and valleys in an information landscape, and whether their interpretation is congruent with the current scientific understanding of geomorphologic processes. Our empirical results suggest that neither developers' nor lay users' understanding of terrain visualizations is based on universal understanding of the true process that has shaped a natural landscape into hills and valleys, mountains, and canyons. Our findings also suggest that the information landscape metaphor for sense making of a document collection is not self-evident to lay users, as claimed by information landscape designers. While a deep understanding of geomorphology will probably not be required to successfully use an information landscape, we do suggest that a coherent theory on how people use space will be necessary to produce cognitively useful information visualizations.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "With continued advances in communication network technology and sensing technology, there is astounding growth in the amount of data produced and made available through cyberspace. Efficient and high-quality clustering of large datasets continues to be one of the most important problems in large-scale data analysis. A commonly used methodology for cluster analysis on large datasets is the three-phase framework of sampling/summarization, iterative cluster analysis, and disk-labeling. There are three known problems with this framework which demand effective solutions. The first problem is how to effectively define and validate irregularly shaped clusters, especially in large datasets. Automated algorithms and statistical methods are typically not effective in handling these particular clusters. The second problem is how to effectively label the entire data on disk (disk-labeling) without introducing additional errors, including the solutions for dealing with outliers, irregular clusters, and cluster boundary extension. The third obstacle is the lack of research about issues related to effectively integrating the three phases. In this article, we describe iVIBRATE\u2014an interactive visualization-based three-phase framework for clustering large datasets. The two main components of iVIBRATE are its VISTA visual cluster-rendering subsystem which invites human interplay into the large-scale iterative clustering process through interactive visualization, and its adaptive ClusterMap labeling subsystem which offers visualization-guided disk-labeling solutions that are effective in dealing with outliers, irregular clusters, and cluster boundary extension. Another important contribution of iVIBRATE development is the identification of the special issues presented in integrating the two components and the sampling approach into a coherent framework, as well as the solutions for improving the reliability of the framework and for minimizing the amount of errors generated within the cluster analysis process. We study the effectiveness of the iVIBRATE framework through a walkthrough example dataset of a million records and we experimentally evaluate the iVIBRATE approach using both real-life and synthetic datasets. Our results show that iVIBRATE can efficiently involve the user in the clustering process and generate high-quality clustering results for large datasets.",

Using various methods and tools of social network analysis and geographical visualization, results were obtained, showing the structure and patterns of research collaborations in topological and geographical views, as well as the geographical distributions of contribution.Design/methodology/approach The sample includes all studies published in the top journal in library science in China from 2006 to 2015. First, co-occurrence data representing collaborations among regions was extracted from author affiliations. Second, the topological network of collaboration was generated by applying social network analysis tools and descriptive statistics, network indicators of the collaboration network and research communities were calculated. Third, the topological network was projected into a geographical map with corresponding coordinates and distances using geographical tools. Finally, the topological network maps and the geographical maps were produced for visualization.Findings The levels of contribution are very unbalanced between regions, and overall research collaboration is low. Beijing, Hubei and several other areas are central and significant regions in China; other regions are mostly connected with central ones through direct collaborations. Research collaborations in LS research in China are mostly distributed in the east and south of China, being centralized in the \u201cBeijing\u2013Hubei\u2013Shanghai\u201d triangle zone, as well as within the triangle\u2019s extending zones. Finally, there are three distinct research communities that connect closely within themselves and loosely between them. The Beijing community is relatively centralized in geography, while other communities are scattered.Originality/value This study applied various methods and tools of social network analysis and geographical mapping analysis to reveal the collaboration structure and patterns among regions in LS research in China. Visualized maps in topological and geographical views help shed new light on research efforts.",

        "Abstract": "Multiple-view visualisations offer several advantages, such as providing different perspectives on the data. However, there are also associated cognitive costs, including the load on working memory and the effort required for comparison. Furthermore, little perception-based research has been conducted, with few answers to questions such as what tasks multiple views are best used for. Since task performance can be limited by visual attention and working memory, this article investigates how different tasks and their respective loads on attention and working memory affect the usability of two different multiple-view visualisations, namely sequential and simultaneous views. In Study 1, the effects when attention was loaded were studied, where users performed a real-time monitoring task. The results suggest that the divided attention problem was an issue with both view types, but design issues apparent with the simultaneous view were not issues with the sequential view. In Study 2, the effects when working memory was loaded were studied, where users made comparisons of different object sets. The results support the previous work on visual- and memory-based comparisons, i.e. the simultaneous view was more useful than the sequential view. The outcomes from both studies illustrate the importance of understanding how different tasks and their impact on attention and working memory can influence the usability of multiple-view visualisations.",

The proposed methodology is based on the use of bibliometrics; i.e., analysis is conducted using information regarding trends and patterns of publication rather than the actual content. In particular, we explore the use of term co-occurrence frequencies as an indicator of semantic closeness between pairs of terms. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, a number of visualizations are generated for a collection of renewable energy related keywords. As these keywords are regarded as manifestations of the associated research topics, we contend that the proposed visualizations can be interpreted as representations of the underlying technology landscape.",

Complex patterns of eight maps were evaluated taking into account both the local proximity of disciplines and the whole structure of presented domains. Final clustering quality value was introduced and calculated in reference to the knowledge domains. The authors underlined the role of quantitative and qualitative methods in combination in the mapping evaluation. The best results were obtained with the T-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) algorithm.

Our goal is to leverage social media users as \u201csocial sensors\u201d in order to increase the situational awareness within and about urban areas. In addition to the well-known challenges of event and topic detection and tracking, this task involves a spatial and temporal dimension. In this paper, we present a visualization that supports analysts in monitoring events/topics and emotions both in time and in space. The visualization uses a clock-face metaphor to encode temporal and spatial relationships, a color map to reflect emotion, and tag clouds for events and topics. A hierarchy of these clock-faces supports drilling down to finer levels of granularity as well as rolling up the vast and fast flow of information. In order to showcase these functionalities of our visualization, we discuss several case studies that use the live data stream of the Twitter microblogging service. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness and usability of the visualization in a user study that we conducted.",

In recent years, the research of more open spatial perspective, such as spatial and scene perception, has gradually turned to the recognition of contextual cues, accumulating rich literature and becoming a hotspot of interdisciplinary research. Nevertheless, besides the fields of psychology and neuroscience, researchers in other fields lack systematic knowledge of contextual cues. The purpose of this study is to expand the research field of contextual cues. Design/methodology/approach: We retrieved 494 papers on contextual cues from SCI/SSCI core database of the Web of Science in 1992\u20132019. Then, we used several bibliometric and sophisticated network analysis tools, such as HistCite, CiteSpace, VOSviewe and Pajek, to identify the time-and-space knowledge map, research hotspots, evolution process, emerging trends and primary path of contextual cues. Findings: The paper found the core scholars, major journals, research institutions, and the popularity of citation to be closely related to the research of contextual cues. In addition, we constructed a co-word network of contextual cues, confirming the concept of behavior implementation intentions and filling in the research gap in the field of behavior science. Then, the quantitative analysis of the burst literature on contextual cues revealed that the research on it that focused more on multi-objective cues. Furthermore, an analysis of the main path helped researchers clearly understand and grasp in the development trend and evolution track of contextual cues. Originality/value: Given academic research usually lags behind management practice, our systematic review of the literature to a certain extent make a bridge between theory and practice.",

It examines the distribution of research outputs and languages, identifies the active journals and institutions, dissects the network of categories and cited references, and interprets the hot research topics.Design/methodology/approach The source data are derived from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection. To reveal the holistic landscape of this field, VOSviewer and CiteSpace as popular visualization tools are employed to process the bibliographic data including author, category, reference, and keyword. Furthermore, the parameter design of the visualization tools follows the general procedures and methods for bibliometric analysis.Findings There is an obviously rapid growth in digital humanities research. English is still the leading academic language in this field. The most influential authors all come from or have scientific relationships with Europe and North America, and two leading countries of which are the UK and USA. Digital humanities is the result of a dynamic dialogue between humanistic exploration and digital means. This research field is closely associated with history, literary and cultural heritage, and information and library science.Research limitations/implications This analysis relies on the metadata information extracted from the WoS database; however, some valuable literatures in the field of digital humanities may not be retrieved from the database owing to the inherent challenge of topic search. This study is also restricted by the scope of publications, the limitation regarding the source of data is that WoS database may have underrepresented publications in this domain.Originality/value The output of this paper could be a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners interesting in the knowledge domain of digital humanities. Moreover, the conclusions of this retrospective analysis can be deemed as the comparable foundation for future study.",

Web search traffic information enables researchers and practitioners to better understand consumers in terms of their preferences and interests, among other things. The purpose of this paper is to use web search traffic information provided by Google Trends to derive relationships among product brands as well as those between product brands and product attributes to propose a method to enhance the visibility of consumer brand positioning.Design/methodology/approach This study builds upon the interesting observation that consumers\u2019 behavior in performing simultaneous searches, or searches including two or more keywords, can be converted into data indicating relationships among brands as well as those between brands and their attributes. The study focuses on the cases of hybrid cars and tablet PCs, and applies a social network analysis method to identify these relationships. Time series information on web search traffic is used because it can track these two product groups from the early stages to the present. This step is completed to verify the changes in the status of each brand and in their relationships that occurred in consumers\u2019 minds over time.Findings Results show that consumers\u2019 web search behaviors reveal the brand positioning and brand-attribute associations in their minds. Specifically, using consumers\u2019 simultaneous search data, the authors derived relationships among brands (brand-brand network) from consumers\u2019 behaviors of searching simultaneously for two brands and the relationships between brands and attributes (brand-product attributes network) from consumers\u2019 behavior of searching simultaneously for a specific brand and certain product attributes.Originality/value Theoretically, this study verifies that consumers\u2019 web search traffic information can be used to microscopically identify the positions of individual brands and their relationships in the minds of consumers. Regarding practical applications, this study proposes a method that can be used by companies to track how consumers perceive their brands by performing a simple and cost-effective analysis using the free search traffic information provided by Google.",

We obtained the following findings: The transfer of central research topics in the field of scientometrics is accelerating. There have been three milestones: the middle of the 1990s, 2005, and 2010. The number of central research topics has also changed from one between 1971 and 1993 to two after 1994 and three after 2008. At the same time, the geographical centres of scientometrics research showed a general shift from the US and Britain to Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, and China. At present, the countries that are centres of research include the Netherlands, US, Belgium, China, Spain, and Italy. There is a close positive correlation between the transfer of the central research topic and the transformation of the country to a centre of research. The countries acting as centres of research enjoy not only a high output of literature, but also a great academic influence. Both the theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.",

Big data on public libraries in London and Seoul were collected, respectively, from Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy and the Korean government\u2019s website for drawing a Chernoff face. The association of variables and human facial features was decided by survey. Although limited in its capacity to handle a large number of variables (eight were analyzed in this study) the Chernoff face method does readily allow for the comparison of a large number of instances of analysis. A total of 58 Chernoff faces were drawn from the formatted data by using the R programming language.Findings The study reveals that most of the local governments in London perform better than those of Seoul. This consequence is due to the fact that local governments in London operate more libraries, invest more budgets, allocate more staff and hold more collections than local governments in Seoul. This administration resulted in more use of libraries in London than Seoul. The study validates the benefit of using the Chernoff face method for big data analysis of library services.Practical implications The Chernoff face method for big data analysis offers a new evaluation technique for library services and provides insights that may not be as readily apparent and discernible using more traditional analytical methods.Originality/value This study is the first to use the Chernoff face method for big data analysis of library services in library and information research.",

Abstract Governmental and local authorities are facing many new information and communication technologies challenges. The amount of data is rapidly increasing. The data sets are published in different formats. New services are based on linking and processing differently structured data from various sources. Users expect openness of public data, fast processing, and intuitive visualisation. The article addresses the challenges and proposes a new government enterprise architecture framework. The following partial architectures are included: big and open linked data storage, processing, and publishing using cloud computing. At first, the key concepts are defined. Next, the basic architectural roles and components are specified. The components result from the decomposition of related frameworks. The main part of the article deals with the detailed proposal of the architecture framework and partial views on architecture (sub-architectures). A methodology, including a proposal of appropriate steps, solutions and responsibilities for them, is described in the next step - after the verification and validation of the new framework with respect to the attributes of quality.

        "Abstract": "Purpose: Visual analytics is increasingly becoming a prominent technology for organizations seeking to gain knowledge and actionable insights from heterogeneous and big data to support decision-making. Whilst a broad range of visual analytics platforms exists, limited research has been conducted to explore the specific factors that influence their adoption in organizations. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework for visual analytics adoption that synthesizes the factors related to the specific nature and characteristics of visual analytics technology. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies a directed content analysis approach to online evaluation reviews of visual analytics platforms to identify the salient determinants of visual analytics adoption in organizations from the standpoint of practitioners. The online reviews were gathered from Gartner.com, and included a sample of 1,320 reviews for six widely adopted visual analytics platforms. Findings: Based on the content analysis of online reviews, 34 factors emerged as key predictors of visual analytics adoption in organizations. These factors were synthesized into a conceptual framework of visual analytics adoption based on the diffusion of innovations theory and technology\u2013organization\u2013environment framework. The findings of this study demonstrated that the decision to adopt visual analytics technologies is not merely based on the technological factors. Various organizational and environmental factors have also significant influences on visual analytics adoption in organizations. Research limitations/implications: This study extends the previous work on technology adoption by developing an adoption framework that is aligned with the specific nature and characteristics of visual analytics technology and the factors involved to increase the utilization and business value of visual analytics in organizations. Practical implications: This study highlights several factors that organizations should consider to facilitate the broad adoption of visual analytics technologies among IT and business professionals. Originality/value: This study is among the first to use the online evaluation reviews to systematically explore the main factors involved in the acceptance and adoption of visual analytics technologies in organizations. Thus, it has potential to provide theoretical foundations for further research in this important and emerging field. The development of an integrative model synthesizing the salient determinants of visual analytics adoption in enterprises should ultimately allow both information systems researchers and practitioners to better understand how and why users form perceptions to accept and engage in the adoption of visual analytics tools and applications.",

The purpose of this paper is to offer a systematic analysis and critique of such models.Design/methodology/approach A framework for analysis synthesised from the literature presented and applied to nine examples.Findings The strengths of the lifecycle representation are to clarify stages in research and to capture key features of project-based research. Nevertheless, their weakness is that they typically mask various aspects of the complexity of research, constructing it as highly purposive, serial, uni-directional and occurring in a somewhat closed system. Other types of models such as spiral of knowledge creation or the data journey reveal other stories about research. It is suggested that we need to develop other metaphors and visualisations around research.Research limitations/implications The paper explores the strengths and weaknesses of the popular lifecycle model for research and RDM, and also considers alternative ways of representing them.Practical implications Librarians use lifecycle models to explain service offerings to users so the analysis will help them identify clearly the best type of representation for particular cases. The critique offered by the paper also reveals that because researchers do not necessarily identify with a lifecycle representation, alternative ways of representing research need to be developed.Originality/value The paper offers a systematic analysis of visualisations of research and RDM current in the Library and Information Studies literature revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the lifecycle metaphor.",

Two drawbacks of radar plots \u2013 the presence of missing information and ordering of indicators \u2013 are addressed. Ten different orthopaedic surgery procedures were considered in this study. Moreover, twelve outcome indicators were provided for each of the 10 surgeries of interest. These indicators were displayed using a radar plot, which we call a scorecard. At the hospital level, we propose a facile process by which to consolidate our 10 scorecards into one. We addressed the ordering of indicators in our scorecards by considering the national median of the indicators as a benchmark. Furthermore, our the consolidated scorecard facilitates concise visualisation and dissemination of complex data. It also enables the classification of providers into potential low and high performers that warrant further investigation. In conclusion, radar plots provide a clear and effective comparative tool for discerning multiple outcome indicators against the benchmarks of patient admission. A case study between two top and bottom performers on a consolidated scorecard (at hospital level) showed that medical provider charges varied more than other outcome indicators.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose visualization techniques as a new representation for privacy policies instead of traditional textual representation and to examine empirically their effects on users' information privacy awareness level. Design/methodology/approach: The authors selected as a case the privacy policy of Instagram and conducted two empirical investigations, each one with three interventions and each representing a different version of the Instagram privacy policy to users. Through a pre- and a post-questionnaire, the authors examined the effects that each representation technique had on the users' privacy awareness level. Findings: The paper finds that visualized privacy policies lead to higher privacy awareness levels than conventional textual ones, especially when icons are included. Research limitations/implications: The authors implemented two new representation techniques offering beneficial guidelines for designing more attractive privacy policy representations. However, the samples are rather limited for generalization to the wide population; nonetheless, they are significant to demonstrate the effect of visualized techniques. The findings might also be subject to bias (e.g. brand bias), although the authors took necessary methodological actions to prevent bias. Practical implications: The results and the methodology of the paper could guide practitioners for the representation of a privacy policy, given that the authors provide systematic and concrete steps. Originality/value: This paper examines the value of privacy policy visualization as a new approach for enabling user privacy awareness, as well as implements two visualization techniques for a given privacy policy. The paper and its findings should be useful for researchers, as well as for practitioners.",

Real-time processing and learning of conflicting data, especially messages coming from different ideas, locations, and time, in a dynamic environment such as Twitter is a challenging task that recently gained lots of attention. This paper introduces a framework for managing, processing, analyzing, detecting, and tracking topics in streaming data. We propose a model selector procedure with a hybrid indicator to tackle the challenge of online topic detection. In this framework, we built an automatic data processing pipeline with two levels of cleaning. Regular and deep cleaning are applied using multiple sources of meta knowledge to enhance data quality. Deep learning and transfer learning techniques are used to classify health-related tweets, with high accuracy and improved F1-Score. In this system, we used visualization to have a better understanding of trending topics. To demonstrate the validity of this framework, we implemented and applied it to health-related twitter data from users originating in the USA over nine months. The results of this implementation show that this framework was able to detect and track the topics at a level comparable to manual annotation. To better explain the emerging and changing topics in various locations over time the result is graphically displayed on top of the United States map.",

A comprehensive framework for disease management must fully connect the complete disease lifecycle, including emergence from reservoir populations, zoonotic vector transmission, and impact on human societies. The Framework for Infectious Disease Analysis is a software environment and conceptual architecture for data integration, situational awareness, visualization, prediction, and intervention assessment. Framework for Infectious Disease Analysis automatically collects biosurveillance data using natural language processing, integrates structured and unstructured data from multiple sources, applies advanced machine learning, and uses multi-modeling for analyzing disease dynamics and testing interventions in complex, heterogeneous populations. In the illustrative case studies, natural language processing from social media, news feeds, and websites was used for information extraction, biosurveillance, and situation awareness. Classification machine learning algorithms (support vector machines, random forests, and boosting) were used for disease predictions.",

Ten occupational therapists trialled the three-dimensional measurement aid prototype application; think-aloud and semi-structured interview data was collected. Usability was measured with the System Usability Scale. Participants scored three-dimensional measurement aid prototype as 'excellent' and agreed strongly with items relating to the usability and learnability of the application. The qualitative analysis identified opportunities for improving existing practice, including, improved interpretation/recording measurements; enhanced collaborative practice within the assistive equipment provision process.

        "Abstract": "Big Data is a research field involving a large number of collaborating disciplines. Based on bibliometric data downloaded from the Web of Science, this study applies various social network analysis and visualization tools to examine the structure and patterns of interdisciplinary collaborations, as well as the recently evolving overall pattern. This study presents the descriptive statistics of disciplines involved in publishing Big Data research; and network indicators of the interdisciplinary collaborations among disciplines, interdisciplinary communities, interdisciplinary networks, and changes in discipline communities over time. The findings indicate that the scope of disciplines involved in Big Data research is broad, but that the disciplinary distribution is unbalanced. The overall collaboration among disciplines tends to be concentrated in several key fields. According to the network indicators, Computer Science, Engineering, and Business and Economics are the most important contributors to Big Data research, given their position and role in the research collaboration network. Centering around a few important disciplines, all fields related to Big Data research are aggregated into communities, suggesting some related research areas, and directions for Big Data research. An ever-changing roster of related disciplines provides support, as illustrated by the evolving graph of communities.",

In this paper, we present the NexusEditor, which can ease this task by providing a graphical user interface to design schemas for spatial and technical context models, interactively create queries, send them to a server and visualize the results. One main contribution is to show how schema awareness can improve such a tool: The NexusEditor dynamically parses the underlying data model and provides additional syntactic checks, semantic checks, and short-cuts based on the schema information. Furthermore, the tool helps to design new schema definitions based on the existing ones, which is crucial for an iterative and user-centric development of context-aware applications. Finally, it provides interfaces to existing information spaces and visualization tools for spatial data like GoogleEarth.",

To establish the professional terms of EC, this work divides EC development into three periods: the development of the Internet, the growth of information technology, and the extension of commerce applications. For exploring significant and latent EC topics, this study analyzes the differences and similarities between international and Taiwanese sources. Pursuing this approach yields three findings. First, this paper determines that the KeyGraph as a computing process and a visualization tool is an effective method for exploring future research topics. Second, international EC topics have different thematic characteristics at different phases and they are more diverse and extensive than Taiwanese sources. Third, a professional thesaurus is very helpful in identifying EC research topics. All these findings suggest Taiwanese scholars should pay more attention to research issues from international journals when studying EC.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: Applied computational ontologies (ACOs) are increasingly used in data science domains to produce semantic enhancement and interoperability among divergent data. The purpose of this paper is to propose and implement a methodology for researching the sociotechnical dimensions of data-driven ontology work, and to show how applied ontologies are communicatively constituted with ethical implications. Design/methodology/approach: The underlying idea is to use a data assemblage approach for studying ACOs and the methods they use to add semantic complexity to digital data. The author uses a mixed methods approach, providing an analysis of the widely used Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) through digital methods and visualizations, and presents historical research alongside unstructured interview data with leading experts in BFO development. Findings: The author found that ACOs are products of communal deliberation and decision making across institutions. While ACOs are beneficial for facilitating semantic data interoperability, ACOs may produce unintended effects when semantically enhancing data about social entities and relations. ACOs can have potentially negative consequences for data subjects. Further critical work is needed for understanding how ACOs are applied in contexts like the semantic web, digital platforms, and topic domains. ACOs do not merely reflect social reality through data but are active actors in the social shaping of data. Originality/value: The paper presents a new approach for studying ACOs, the social impact of ACO work, and describes methods that may be used to produce further applied ontology studies.",

As technology adoption rapidly increases, operational telehealth teams must maintain awareness of critical information, such as patient volumes and wait times, patient and provider experience, and telehealth platform performance. Using a model of situation awareness as a conceptual foundation and a user-centered design approach we describe our process for rapidly developing and disseminating dashboard visualizations to support telehealth operations. We used a 5-step process to gain domain knowledge, identify user needs, identify data sources, design and develop visualizations, and iteratively refine these visualizations. Through this process we identified 3 distinct stakeholder groups and designed and developed visualization dashboards to meet their needs. Feedback from users demonstrated the dashboard's support situation awareness and informed important operational decisions. Lessons learned are shared to provide other organizations with insights from our process.",

This research investigates the concept of business intelligence from the perceptions of information department staff at academic libraries in Jordan. The opportunities and challenges associated with it are also discussed and explored. As indicated by the results, information department staff agree that business intelligence improves decision-making, helping decision-makers to make the most accurate and timely decisions for the library. The results also indicate that an appropriate infrastructure is important for the successful implementation of business intelligence in academic libraries in Jordan.",

How tribal libraries translate value also posed another challenge. Because the research was conducted in a single tribal library, further research in different, expanded settings and contexts is suggested.Originality/value This study is one of the first to investigate tribal library activities by exploring report data and quantitatively using information visualization techniques.",

        "Abstract": "The technological advancements in the field of computing are giving rise to the generation of gigantic volumes of data which are beyond the handling capabilities of the conventionally available tools, techniques and systems. These types of data are known as big data. Moreover with the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), these types of data have increased in multiple folds in 7Vs (volume, variety, veracity, value, variability, velocity and visualisation). There are several techniques prevalent in today's time for handling these types of huge data. Hadoop is one such open source framework which has emerged as a de facto technology for handling such huge datasets. In an IoT ecosystem, real-time handling of requests is an imperative requirement; however, Hadoop has certain limitations while handling these types of requests. In this article, we present an energy-efficient architecture for effective, secured and real-time handling of IoT big data. The proposed approach adopts atrain distributed system (ADS) to construct the core architecture. This study uses software-defined networking (SDN) framework for energy-efficient and optimal routing of data and requests from source to destination, and vice versa. Furthermore, to ensure secured handling of IoT big data, the proposed approach uses 'Twofish' cryptographic technique for encrypting the information captured by the sensors. Finally, the concept of 'request-type' identifying unit has been proposed. Instead of handling all the requests in an identical way, the proposed approach works by characterising the requests on the basis of certain criteria and parameters, which are identified here.",

This paper addresses the factors that affect how people engage with data visualizations, a relatively under-researched focus in visualization research to date. Drawing on qualitative, empirical research with users, we identify six factors that affect engagement: subject matter; source/media location; beliefs and opinions; time; emotions; and confidence and skills. In drawing attention to these factors, we bring HCI concerns together with approaches to media audience research, to identify new themes for visualization research. In particular, we argue that our findings have implications for how effectiveness is conceived and defined in relation to data visualizations and how this varies depending on how, by whom, where and for what purpose visualizations are encountered. Our paper aims to extend the horizons of visualization research, in its focus on factors that affect engagement and how these suggest new definitions of effectiveness.",

To gain valuable knowledge about customers, it becomes increasingly important for businesses to collect, monitor, analyze, summarize, and visualize online customer reviews posted on social media platforms such as online forums. However, analyzing social media data is challenging due to the vast increase of social media data. The purpose of this paper is to present an approach of using natural language preprocessing, text mining and sentiment analysis techniques to analyze online customer reviews related to various hotels through a case study.Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a tested approach of using natural language preprocessing, text mining, and sentiment analysis techniques to analyze online textual content. The value of the proposed approach was demonstrated through a case study using online hotel reviews.Findings The study found that the overall review star rating correlates pretty well with the sentiment scores for both the title and the full content of the online customer review. The case study also revealed that both extremely satisfied and extremely dissatisfied hotel customers share a common interest in the five categories: food, location, rooms, service, and staff.Originality/value This study analyzed the online reviews from English-speaking hotel customers in China to understand their preferred hotel attributes, main concerns or demands. This study also provides a feasible approach and a case study as an example to help enterprises more effectively apply social media analytics in practice.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Purpose: During recent years, web technologies and mass media have become prevalent in the context of medicine and health. Two examples of important web technologies used in health are news media and patient forums. Both have a significant role in shaping patients' perspective and behaviour in relation to health and illness, as well as the way that they might choose or change their treatment. In this paper, the authors investigated the application of web technologies using the data analysis approach. The authors did this analysis from the point of view of topics being discussed and disseminated via patients and journalists in breast and lung cancer. The study also investigated the (dis)alignment amongst these two groups and scientists in terms of topics. Design/methodology/approach: Three data sets comprised documents published between 2014 and 2018 obtained from ProQuest and Web of Science Medline databases, alongside data from three major patient forums on breast and lung cancer. The analysis and visualisation in this paper have been done using the udpipe, igraph R packages and VOSviewer. Findings: The study's findings showed that in general scientists focussed more on prognosis and treatment of cancer, whereas patients and journalists focussed more on detection, prevention and role of social and emotional support. The only exception was for news coverage of lung cancer where the largest cluster was related to treatment, research in cancer treatment and therapies. However, when comparing coverage by scientists and journalists in terms of treatment, the focus of news articles in both cancer types was mainly on chemotherapy and complimentary therapies. Finally, topics such as lifestyle or pain management were only discussed by breast cancer patients. Originality/value: The results obtained from this study may provide valuable insights into topics of interest for each group of scientists, journalist and patients as well as (dis)alignment among them in terms of topics. These findings are important as scientific research is heavily dependent on communication, and research does not exist in a bubble. Scientists and journalists can gain insights from patients' experiences and needs, which in turn may help them to have a more holistic and realistic view.

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Data have become an essential factor in driving health research and are key to the development of personalized and precision medicine. Primary and secondary use of personal data holds significant potential for research; however, it also introduces a new set of challenges around consent processes, privacy, and data sharing. Research institutions have issued ethical guidelines to address challenges and ensure responsible data processing and data sharing. However, ethical guidelines directed at researchers and medical professionals are often complex; require readers who are familiar with specific terminology; and can be hard to understand for people without sufficient background knowledge in legislation, research, and data processing practices.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aimed to visually represent an ethics framework to make its content more accessible to its stakeholders. More generally, we wanted to explore the potential of visualizing policy documents to combat and prevent research misconduct by improving the capacity of actors in health research to handle data responsibly.<bold>Methods: </bold>We used a mixed methods approach based on knowledge visualization with 3 sequential steps: qualitative content analysis (open and axial coding, among others); visualizing the knowledge structure, which resulted from the previous step; and adding interactive functionality to access information using rapid prototyping.<bold>Results: </bold>Through our iterative methodology, we developed a tool that allows users to explore an ethics framework for data sharing through an interactive visualization. Our results represent an approach that can make policy documents easier to understand and, therefore, more applicable in practice.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Meaningful communication and understanding each other remain a challenge in various areas of health care and medicine. We contribute to advancing communication practices through the introduction of knowledge visualization to bioethics to offer a novel way to tackle this relevant issue.",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 In total, 50 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to a condition (Control, Keyword Matrix, Wonder Wheel, Visual Search) and instructed to find relevant article citations on unfamiliar topics in EBSCO's Academic Search Complete. All students completed a pre-test to provide baseline data. Control subjects performed one additional search. Students in the experimental conditions were introduced to the relevant information visualization strategy, employed it to identify keywords for two post-test searches, and provided a written assessment of its impact. Audio and screen captures from search sessions were recorded, transcribed and analyzed. Findings \u2013 Brainstorming Behavior: Wonder Wheel subjects spent significantly more time brainstorming search terms than those relying on the Keyword Matrix. Search Behavior: Visual Search subjects utilized significantly more search concepts and attempted more searches. Evaluation: Students expressed satisfaction with all three tools tested; however, a subset of Visual Search subjects verbalized frustration as they searched. The Visual Search produced desirable student search behaviors. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The study sample was limited (50 undergraduates from a single institution) and student searches were not motivated by authentic information needs. Originality/value \u2013 This study offers insight into how information visualization tools can be leveraged to improve undergraduate search behavior.

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Background: Healthcare organizations around the world are challenged by pressures to reduce cost, improve coordination and outcome, and provide more with less. This requires effective planning and evidence-based practice by generating important information from available data. Thus, flexible and user-friendly ways to represent, query, and visualize health data becomes increasingly important. International organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) regularly publish vital data on priority health topics that can be utilized for public health policy and health service development. However, the data in most portals is displayed in either Excel or PDF formats, which makes information discovery and reuse difficult. Linked Open Data (LOD)--a new Semantic Web set of best practice of standards to publish and link heterogeneous data--can be applied to the representation and management of public level health data to alleviate such challenges. However, the technologies behind building LOD systems and their effectiveness for health data are yet to be assessed. Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate whether Linked Data technologies are potential options for health information representation, visualization, and retrieval systems development and to identify the available tools and methodologies to build Linked Data-based health information systems. Methods: We used the Resource Description Framework (RDF) for data representation, Fuseki triple store for data storage, and Sgvizler for information visualization. Additionally, we integrated SPARQL query interface for interacting with the data. We primarily use the WHO health observatory dataset to test the system. All the data were represented using RDF and interlinked with other related datasets on the Web of Data using Silk--a link discovery framework for Web of Data. A preliminary usability assessment was conducted following the System Usability Scale (SUS) method. Results: We developed an LOD-based health information representation, querying, and visualization system by using Linked Data tools. We imported more than 20,000 HIV-related data elements on mortality, prevalence, incidence, and related variables, which are freely available from the WHO global health observatory database. Additionally, we automatically linked 5312 data elements from DBpedia, Bio2RDF, and LinkedCT using the Silk framework. The system users can retrieve and visualize health information according to their interests. For users who are not familiar with SPARQL queries, we integrated a Linked Data search engine interface to search and browse the data. We used the system to represent and store the data, facilitating flexible queries and different kinds of visualizations. The preliminary user evaluation score by public health data managers and users was 82 on the SUS usability measurement scale. The need to write queries in the interface was the main reported difficulty of LOD-based systems to the end user. Conclusions: The system introduced in this article shows that current LOD technologies are a promising alternative to represent heterogeneous health data in a flexible and reusable manner so that they can serve intelligent queries, and ultimately support decision-making. However, the development of advanced text-based search engines is necessary to increase its usability especially for nontechnical users. Further research with large datasets is recommended in the future to unfold the potential of Linked Data and Semantic Web for future health information systems development.",

        "Abstract": "This paper provides a citation network analysis of the publications of the journal Higher Education from 1972 to 2014 inclusive. This represents nearly the entire history of the journal. It analyses the most published authors and the most cited articles, as well as the most cited authors. This data includes the highest number of publications both by institution and country of origin. 2176 articles were taken from Web of Science\u2122 as a source of primary data. These articles were found to have 68,009 references. Analysis was carried out using the Web of Science\u2122 online analytics tool and Excel. Gephi\u2122, a data visualisation and manipulation software, was then used to provide visual representations of the associated citation networks. These representations were shown to constitute 'terrains' of citations or 'geographies of influence'-effectively bringing to bear empirical data in support of Macfarlane's higher education research 'archipelago'. Nationality biases were observed between US and UK/European/Australian higher education journals. Results indicate that the most published authors throughout the journal's history are Meyer, Kember, Richardson, Enders and Prosser. Confirming earlier studies on UK and Australian journals, the five most cited authors are Entwistle, Clark, Marton, Biggs and Ramsden. The single most cited article is Clark's 1983 Higher education system: academic organization in cross-national perspective. The top publication years for the journal were 2012, 2009 and 2011. Results from this paper shed light into the evolving concerns of the journal and its readership, and provide a demonstration of a powerful way of analysing citation data.",

Design/methodology/approach: A two-stage experiment was designed and conducted so as to follow and quantify the searching process in specific searching target case and no specific searching target case when using VDL-based iconic tags. Findings: The experimental results manifested that VDL-based iconic tags enhanced the role of tag in information searching. They could make user better understand tag clusters, which, in turn, provide global structure of involved topics. Also, VDL-based iconic tags helped user to find out searching target more quickly with higher accuracy by taking advantages of visual representation of tag categories and symbolic signification of tag content. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to verify how structured icons work in information searching and how user's graphical cognition impacts on tag-based information searching process.

Assessing the efficacy of systems that enable accurate and timely clinical decision making merits corresponding attention. This paper discusses the multiple-reader multiple-case (MRMC) experimental design and linear mixed models as means of assessing and comparing decision accuracy and latency (time) for decision tasks in which clinician readers must interpret visual displays of data. These tools can assess and compare decision accuracy and latency (time). These experimental and statistical techniques, used extensively in radiology imaging studies, offer a number of practical and analytic advantages over more traditional quantitative methods such as percent-correct measurements and ANOVAs, and are recommended for their statistical efficiency and generalizability. An example analysis using readily available, free, and commercial statistical software is provided as an appendix. While these techniques are not appropriate for all evaluation questions, they can provide a valuable addition to the evaluative toolkit of medical informatics research.",

        "Abstract": "During the Covid-19 pandemic, people rely on the Internet in order to obtain information that can help them understand the coronavirus crisis. This situation has exposed the need to ensure that everyone has access to essential information on equal terms. During this situation, statistical charts have been used to display data related to the pandemic, and have had an important role in conveying, clarifying and simplifying information provided by governments and health organisations. Scientific literature and the guidelines published by organizations have focused on proposing solutions to make charts accessible for blind people or people with very little visual rest. However, the same efforts are not made towards people with low vision, despite their higher prevalence in the population of users with visual impairment. This paper reviews the accessibility of the statistical charts about the Covid-19 crisis for people with low vision that were published by the Brazilian, British, Russian, Spanish, European Union, and the United States' governments and also by the World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins University, relating to the countries most severely affected by the pandemic. The review is based on specific heuristic indicators, with a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach. Overall, the reviewed charts offer a reasonable level of accessibility, although there are some relevant problems affecting many of the low vision profiles that remain to be solved. The main problems identified are: poor text alternatives in both, raster images and SVG charts; the incompatibility with a keyboard interface; insufficient non-text contrast against adjacent colours (in chart elements such as bars, lines or areas), no customization options; and the lack of an optimized print version for users for whom reading on screen is challenging.",

It explores a new way of representing the topological relationships among 3D geographical features such as buildings and their internal partitions or subunits. The 3D topological data model is called the combinatorial data model (CDM). It is a logical data model that simplifies and abstracts the complex topological relationships among 3D features through a hierarchical network structure called the node\u2010relation structure (NRS). This logical network structure is abstracted by using the property of Poincar\u00e9 duality. It is modelled and presented in the paper using graph\u2010theoretic formalisms. The model was implemented with real data for evaluating its effectiveness for performing 3D spatial queries and visualization.",

Pain distribution is an important dimension of cancer pain. Assessment of pain distribution is commonly performed on a pain body map. This study explores how a computerized pain body map may function as a communication tool and visualize pain in patients with advanced cancer. In previous studies, we have developed a tablet-based computerized pain body map for use in cancer patients. The aim of this study was to adapt the computerized pain body map program to patients with neuropathic cancer-related pain, and to develop a separate interface for healthcare providers. We also wanted to investigate the perceived usefulness of this system among patients and healthcare providers. Both patients and healthcare providers perceived that the visualization of pain in the computerized pain body map system had potential to be a positive contribution to clinical pain management, and to improve collaboration between healthcare providers.",

Currently, the problems of information overload and difficulty to obtain a comprehensive picture of terrorist activities hinder effective and efficient analysis of terrorist information on the Web. To improve understanding of terrorist activities, we have developed a novel methodology for collecting and analyzing Dark Web information. The methodology incorporates information collection, analysis, and visualization techniques, and exploits various Web information sources. We applied it to collecting and analyzing information of 39 Jihad Web sites and developed visualization of their site contents, relationships, and activity levels. An expert evaluation showed that the methodology is very useful and promising, having a high potential to assist in investigation and understanding of terrorist activities by producing results that could potentially help guide both policymaking and intelligence research.",

        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the difference of subject service between Chinese and German libraries. Subject service is the key direction of user-oriented service in libraries at home and abroad, especially in university libraries. It is an innovative measure to provide service for teaching, learning and research in libraries under the information environment. Subject service has strong practicality, and with the increasing demand of users and the continuous change of external information environment, the service content and mode are gradually improved. Design/methodology/approach: By investigating the selected websites of University Libraries between China and Germany, the specific practice status of subject services between these two countries was known, and the study provided a basis for the comparative analysis of the practice status of subject services between China and Germany. By using the elastic analysis model, the library services in foreign countries and China can be quantitatively analyzed to find out the matching situation between resources and reader's needs, and then formulate the countermeasures for the allocation of literature resources. In this way, readers can find out the hotspot topics which are more in line with their needs, as well as in the field of inquiry. It is also helpful for readers to further study and analyze the knowledge background and subject distribution in this field. Findings: The results show that there are still some deficiencies in China's participation in international scientific research cooperation. By mapping high-frequency keyword co-occurrence network and clustering knowledge map, it is seen that there are differences in user research, information search, subject service platform and other aspects between Chinese and German library subject services. There are also some gaps in such aspects as location, disciplines service website revealing mode, resources support, disciplines service platform and so on. Research limitations/implications: Although this study compares the status of scientific research and practice of discipline services between China and Germany, due to the limited capacity, the paper only selects a number of key points for comparative analysis of discipline services at home and abroad. Due to the limited range of data collected by WOS and Chinese Social Sciences Index, there are some deviations in data processing in the software used, which makes the theoretical research and comparison results have certain limitations. Practical implications: By investigating and analyzing the current situation of subject service in university libraries between China and Germany, this paper points out the shortcomings of subject service in university libraries in China on the basis of comparative analysis and draws on the advanced experience of German subject service to provide guidance for improving the problems in subject service in China. Originality/value: The innovation of this study lies in the comparative analysis of Chinese and German subject services from the perspective of subject service research and work practice and puts forward some strategies to improve the development of domestic subject services. At present, there are few domestic literatures comparing the research status of subject services between China and Germany by using visualization method. This study quantitatively compares the time distribution, knowledge evolution direction, research hotspots and topics of subject services at home and abroad by using visualization technology and summarizes the evolution direction of subject services between China and Germany.",

It is relatively easy to find information that we know exists; you just need to know what you want to find, where to look for it, and how to express yourself. It might require a little effort to find it, but this work is usually rewarded. But, what if you're looking to acquire new knowledge or want to search for unusual findings? Normally you start with what you know and learn as you go and in the end arrive at some conclusion, but how do you know you have found all relevant information and how do you know how this information is connected to the rest of the information space? The answer up until now is that you don't, and to get the big picture you would have to aggregate your results manually. Microsoft has studied search behavior and a big part of the daily searches are exploratory in nature, where the users aren't sure what they want to find and are struggling while trying. The Etsimo Visual Discovery engine offers an alternative, or complement, to lookup searching by providing a transparent and user-driven way to visually navigate the information space, learn as you go, and find relevant information.",

It computes and analyzes the overlap structures between the search results of retrieval systems that participated in the short, long, and manual tracks in TREC 3, 6, 7, and 8 to examine what can be learned to infer a document's probability of being relevant. This paper shows that the potential relevance of a document increases exponentially as the number of systems retrieving it increases\u2014called the Authority Effect. It also shows that documents higher up in ranked lists and found by more systems are more likely to be relevant\u2014called the Ranking Effect. A contribution of this paper is that it shows that the Authority and Ranking Effects can be observed regardless of whether a query is generated manually or automatically and short or long queries are used. Further, it is illustrated that the Authority and Ranking Effects can be observed if the result sets of random groupings of five retrieval systems are compared and only the top 50 results are used in the overlap computation. Also discussed is how the Authority and Ranking Effects can help explain why major data fusion methods perform well.",

Design/methodology/approach: This study took China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) as the data source and extracted keywords from relevant articles in archival information resource research as the sample. First, the frequency and co-occurrence of keywords were calculated by using SCI2. Second, this study analyzed the co-word network indicators by using Pajek. Then, topic community detection was conducted by using a VOS viewer, as well as the visualization of intellectual structures. Next, this study developed a graphical mapping of the evolution of research topics over time by using Cortext. Findings: The research topics of archival information resources in China were unbalanced but distinct. Researchers focus on the construction and utilization of archival information resource, which consist of five evident research directions. The phenomena of fusion and differentiation coexist in research topic evolution. There were both continuities of traditional research and innovations in emerging research. The archival information resource research tended to be systematized and extended, reflecting the vertical and horizontal extension of the research content.

In general, the combination of these two research techniques is useful in understanding the most important collaborative trends in the area and locating key institutional drivers and challenges that open data policymakers face today in implementing related digital collaborative and participatory platforms.Findings The open data concept could provide a promising collaborative platform to network various e-government stakeholders and accelerate related technology-driven public reforms. The successful implementation of the idea demands a fairly equal contribution from representatives of both public and private sectors of economy. The case has also clearly demonstrated the importance of cooperation with the local non-governmental sector, independent developers and journalists, whose active participation is a key factor for the overall progress of the open data phenomenon, to a greater degree, as a collaborative movement rather than an instrument of public sector innovations.Research limitations/implications One of the fundamental limitations of the investigation is that it is a single case study. It explores the development of open data phenomena in the context of such an advanced post-industrial society as Finland. In this regard, in order to support key arguments of the research, it is necessary to compare its findings with the results of similar case studies in other administrative, political and socioeconomic settings, which would open new promising dimensions for future research in this direction.Practical implications Policy recommendations are proposed by the author in the discussion section, which could help, for example, to boost information campaigns in popularizing open data technologies and its reuse among independent developers. A lot of unique visualizations and illustrations are presented in the paper to help readers grasp better key ideas of the research. In this respect, the paper is intended for a global professional community of open data experts, e-government specialists, political scientists, journalists, lawyers, students of public policy and public administration and all those who are interested in studying the phenomenon from the perspective of its key stakeholders.Social implications The author of the paper tried to develop a universal framework of case study research that could be used in investigating phenomena of open data not only in Finland but also in the context of other post-industrial societies, especially in analyzing roles of various stakeholders in adopting open data-driven collaborative and civic engagement platforms and startups.Originality/value This research presents a first case study that investigates a collaborative potential of open data phenomena from a stakeholder perspective in a more holistic manner, especially in analyzing professional networking platforms and related communication activities that meet the interests of stakeholders as diverse as government agents and journalists, independent developers and academia, charities and businesses in an attempt to better understand the fundamental factors of the open data movement as a collaborative socioeconomic trend.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design, www.ted.com/) Talks has been one of the most popular video systems. However, the current TED Talks system expressed its inquired videos as in a two-dimensional (2D) table, which is inconvenient for searching the relationships among videos and tags. This study converts the TED Talks table into a sphere by using optimization techniques to help users search for preferred videos. Design/methodology/approach: There are five phases in this study as follows. Phase 1: Reorganize data of 36 tags and 108 videos; Phase 2: Allocate tags on the TED sphere; Phase 3: Allocate videos on the TED sphere; Phase 4: Develop an online interactive TED retrieval system; and Phase 5: Perform survey and evaluation. Findings: One survey demonstrated that the TED Talks sphere is more convenient for searching videos, as it is more user-friendly because of its graphical user interface, more convenient to use, more useful for retrieving information and can facilitate a more responsive search for users' preferred videos. Research limitations/implications: The numbers of tags and videos able to be displayed on a sphere is limited by the capacity of an optimization software and hardware. Practical implications: The proposed sphere system can be used by a large number of users of TED Talks groups. Social implications: This sphere systems can also be applied to other fields which use 2D forms to display the relationships among objects. Originality/value: This study uses an optimization method to convert a 2D form into a 3D sphere to highlight the relationships among numerous objects.",

        "Abstract": "Objective: Unstructured electronic information sources, such as news reports, are proving to be valuable inputs for public health surveillance. However, staying abreast of current disease outbreaks requires scouring a continually growing number of disparate news sources and alert services, resulting in information overload. Our objective is to address this challenge through the HealthMap.org Web application, an automated system for querying, filtering, integrating and visualizing unstructured reports on disease outbreaks. Design: This report describes the design principles, software architecture and implementation of HealthMap and discusses key challenges and future plans. Measurements: We describe the process by which HealthMap collects and integrates outbreak data from a variety of sources, including news media (e.g., Google News), expert-curated accounts (e.g., PreMED Mail), and validated official alerts. Through the use of text processing algorithms, the system classifies alerts by location and disease and then overlays them on an interactive geographic map. We measure the accuracy of the classification algorithms based on the level of human curation necessary to correct misclassifications, and examine geographic coverage. Results: As part of the evaluation of the system, we analyzed 778 reports with HealthMap, representing 87 disease categories and 89 countries. The automated classifier performed with 84% accuracy, demonstrating significant usefulness in managing the large volume of information processed by the system. Accuracy for PreMED alerts is 91% compared to Google News reports at 81%, as PreMED messages follow a more regular structure. Conclusion: HealthMap is a useful free and open resource employing text-processing algorithms to identify important disease outbreak information through a user-friendly interface.",

While Digital Library support implies many aspects along the whole library workflow model, interactive and visual retrieval allowing effective query formulation and result presentation are important functions. Recently, new kinds of non-textual documents which merit Digital Library support, but yet cannot be fully accommodated by existing Digital Library technology, have come into focus. Scientific data, as produced for example, by scientific experimentation, simulation or observation, is such a document type. In this article we report on a concept and first implementation of Digital Library functionality for supporting visual retrieval and exploration in a specific important class of scientific primary data, namely, time-oriented research data. The approach is developed in an interdisciplinary effort by experts from the library, natural sciences, and visual analytics communities. In addition to presenting the concept and to discussing relevant challenges, we present results from a first implementation of our approach as applied on a real-world scientific primary data set. We also report from initial user feedback obtained during discussions with domain experts from the earth observation sciences, indicating the usefulness of our approach.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to describe the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) project's ongoing efforts to virtually integrate trans-national archival sources via the reconstruction of collection provenance as it relates to copy collections (material copied from one archive to another) and the co-referencing of subject and authority terms across material held by distinct institutions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a case study of approximately 6,000 words length. The authors describe the scope of the problem of archival fragmentation from both cultural and technical perspectives, with particular focus on Holocaust-related material, and describe, with graph-based visualisations, two ways in which EHRI seeks to better integrate information about fragmented material. Findings: As a case study, the principal contributions of this paper include reports on our experience with extracting provenance-based connections between archival descriptions from encoded finding aids and the challenges of co-referencing access points in the absence of domain-specific controlled vocabularies. Originality/value: Record linking in general is an important technique in computational approaches to humanities research and one that has rightly received significant attention from scholars. In the context of historical archives, however, the material itself is in most cases not digitised, meaning that computational attempts at linking must rely on finding aids which constitute much fewer rich data sources. The EHRI project's work in this area is therefore quite pioneering and has implications for archival integration on a larger scale, where the disruptive potential of Linked Open Data is most obvious.",

The results indicate that due to the multifaceted nature of the challenges, the implementation of EHR-DS is not low cost and easy to implement and requires a variety of interventions. On the one hand, the most common challenges include the need to invest significant time and resources; the poor data quality in EHRs; difficulty in analyzing, cleaning, and accessing unstructured data; data privacy and security; and the lack of interoperability standards. On the other hand, the most common solutions are the use of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms for unstructured data; the use of appropriate technical solutions for data retrieval, extraction, identification, and visualization; the collaboration of health and clinical departments to access data; standardizing EHR content for public health; and using a unique health identifier for individuals.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>EHR systems have an important role in modernizing disease surveillance systems.

Finally, it introduces the design of a proposed new architecture to work with Big Data volumes of preserved digital resources \u2013 also based upon experience of managing a collection of 30 million digital images.Findings Modern visualisation tools enable business analyses based on file-related metadata, but most currently available systems need more of this functionality \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d. Scalability of preservation architecture to Big Data volumes depends upon the ability to run preservation processes in parallel, so indexes that enable effective sub-division of collections are vital. Not all processes scale easily: those that do not require complex management.Practical implications The complexities caused by scaling up to Big Data volumes can be seen as being at odds with preservation, where simplicity matters. However, the sustainability of preservation systems relates directly to their usefulness, and maintaining usefulness will increasingly depend upon being able to process digital resources at Big Data volumes. An effective balance between these conflicting situations must be struck.Originality/value Preservation systems are at a step-change as they move to Big Data scale architectures and respond to more technical research processes.

This study investigates the topic through an analysis of drawing and other visual representations, based on a study design that applied a visual, arts-based methodological approach. Participants were invited to focus groups where they were provided with a variety of craft materials, asked to create a visual representation of liaison librarians, then discuss their artifact. The data consists of twenty-eight artifacts, which were content analyzed, and semi-structured interview recordings, which were transcribed and analyzed for themes. Participants expressed liaison librarians positively, as helpers and connectors, as a gateway to knowledge, with complex and varied roles, as trusted sources, and as relationship builders. By drawing attention to these themes, the participants highlighted that liaison librarians are invaluable to Deakin University.",

Design/methodology/approach - One challenge for designers in the context of large-scale repositories is to create interface tools that help users find specific information of interest. In order to be most effective, these tools need to leverage the cognitive characteristics of the target users. At the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the authors' target users are scientists and engineers who can be characterized as higher-order, analytical thinkers. In this paper, the authors describe a visualization tool they have created for making the authors' large-scale digital object repositories more usable for them: SearchGraph, which facilitates data set analysis by displaying search results in the form of a two- or three-dimensional interactive scatter plot. Findings - Using SearchGraph, users can view a condensed, abstract visualization of search results. They can view the same dataset from multiple perspectives by manipulating several display, sort, and filter options. Doing so allows them to see different patterns in the dataset. For example, they can apply a logarithmic transformation in order to create more scatter in a dense cluster of data points or they can apply filters in order to focus on a specific subset of data points. Originality/value - SearchGraph is a creative solution to the problem of how to design interface tools for large-scale repositories. It is particularly appropriate for the authors' target users, who are scientists and engineers. It extends the work of the first two authors on ActiveGraph, a read-write digital library visualization tool.",

        "Abstract": "This article proposes, exemplifies, and validates the use of course-subject co-occurrence ( CSCO) data to generate topic maps of an academic discipline. A CSCO event is when 2 course-subjects are taught in the same academic year by the same teacher. A total of 61,856 CSCO events were extracted from the 2010-11 directory of the American Association of Law Schools and used to visualize the structure of law school education in the United States. Different normalization, ordination (layout), and clustering algorithms were compared and the best performing algorithm of each type was used to generate the final map. Validation studies demonstrate that CSCO produces topic maps that are consistent with expert opinion and 4 other indicators of the topical similarity of law school course-subjects. This research is the first to use CSCO to produce a visualization of a domain. It is also the first to use an expanded, multi-part gold standard to evaluate the validity of domain maps and the intermediate steps in their creation. It is suggested that the framework used herein may be adopted for other studies that compare different inputs of a domain map in order to empirically derive the best maps as measured against extrinsic sources of topical similarity (gold standards).",

Academic libraries are increasingly adopting VR technology for a variety of research and teaching purposes, which include providing enhanced access to digital collections, offering new research tools, and constructing new immersive learning environments for students. This trend suggests that positive technological innovation is flourishing in libraries, but there remains a lack of clear guidance in the library community on how to introduce these technologies in effective ways and make them sustainable within different types of institutions. In June 2018, the University of Oklahoma hosted the second of three forums on the use of 3D and VR for visualization and analysis in academic libraries, as part of the project Developing Library Strategy for 3D and Virtual Reality Collection Development and Reuse (LIB3DVR), funded by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. This qualitative study invited experts from a range of disciplines and sectors to identify common challenges in the visualization and analysis of 3D data, and the management of VR programs, for the purpose of developing a national library strategy.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "The traditional machine learning systems lack a pathway for a human to integrate their domain knowledge into the underlying machine learning algorithms. The utilization of such systems, for domains where decisions can have serious consequences (e.g. medical decision-making and crime analysis), requires the incorporation of human experts' domain knowledge. The challenge, however, is how to effectively incorporate domain expert knowledge with machine learning algorithms to develop effective models for better decision making. In crime analysis, the key challenge is to identify plausible linkages in unstructured crime reports for the hypothesis formulation. Crime analysts painstakingly perform time-consuming searches of many different structured and unstructured databases to collate these associations without any proper visualization. To tackle these challenges and aiming towards facilitating the crime analysis, in this paper, we examine unstructured crime reports through text mining to extract plausible associations. Specifically, we present associative questioning based searching model to elicit multi-level associations among crime entities. We coupled this model with partition clustering to develop an interactive, human-assisted knowledge discovery and data mining scheme. The proposed human-centered knowledge discovery and data mining scheme for crime text mining is able to extract plausible associations between crimes, identifying crime pattern, grouping similar crimes, eliciting co-offender network and suspect list based on spatial-temporal and behavioral similarity. These similarities are quantified through calculating Cosine, Jacquard, and Euclidean distances. Additionally, each suspect is also ranked by a similarity score in the plausible suspect list. These associations are then visualized through creating a two-dimensional re-configurable crime cluster space along with a bipartite knowledge graph. This proposed scheme also inspects the grand challenge of integrating effective human interaction with the machine learning algorithms through a visualization feedback loop. It allows the analyst to feed his/her domain knowledge including choosing of similarity functions for identifying associations, dynamic feature selection for interactive clustering of crimes and assigning weights to each component of the crime pattern to rank suspects for an unsolved crime. We demonstrate the proposed scheme through a case study using the Anonymized burglary dataset. The scheme is found to facilitate human reasoning and analytic discourse for intelligence analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, many neural network models have been successfully applied for histopathological analysis, including for cancer classifications. While some of them reach human\u2013expert level accuracy in classifying cancers, most of them have to be treated as black box, in which they do not offer explanation on how they arrived at their decisions. This lack of transparency may hinder the further applications of neural networks in realistic clinical settings where not only decision but also explainability is important. This study proposes a transparent neural network that complements its classification decisions with visual information about the given problem. The auxiliary visual information allows the user to some extent understand how the neural network arrives at its decision. The transparency potentially increases the usability of neural networks in realistic histopathological analysis. In the experiment, the accuracy of the proposed neural network is compared against some existing classifiers, and the visual information is compared against some dimensional reduction methods.",

The research paves a way to understand the role and required competencies of Library and Information Science (LIS) professionals for the implementation of BDA in libraries. Design/methodology/approach: In the BDA analytics context, a session with a proposed model was presented to the audience to get the response of librarians about the required competencies and skills. The research tool was developed based on the literature review to know the role of LIS professionals and their required competencies/skills for BDA. The questionnaire was distributed in the BDA session to collect the responses of the participating audience on the variables that focused on the role and core competencies of LIS professionals in BDA. In the analysis of results, the independent t-test was applied to know the mean value of the overall response rate. Findings: The findings show that perceptions of LIS professionals in the understanding of BDA ranked high in data privacy, data availability, data organization and data literacy. Digital data curation, policies supervision and providing the data consultancy also showed a significant relationship among these variables. Besides, the correlation between the required skills for BDA, metadata skills, data ethics, data acquisition, data cleaning, data organization, data analysis, digital curation, data clustering, data protection rules and digital visualization also showed a beneficial relationship.

The results show that a range of unique terms was used in individual program descriptions, with common terms being shared across disciplines. DS programs required varying numbers of credit hours, including practicum and capstone. Most DS courses covered the basic level of analytical skills, but upper-level skills were inadequately addressed. Programs in eight disciplines delivered information skills through their core courses, and four addressed communication skills. Six disciplines covered visualization skills through their core courses, yet just three in elective courses. The course offering on mathematics/statistics was rather weak in iSchools. While core courses in iSchools provided communication and visualization skills, their electives courses did not address such skills. These findings have implications for improving DS education in iSchools and across other disciplines.",

Therefore, professionals and scientists need a range of theoretical and practical tools to measure experimental data. This review aims to provide an up-to-date review of the various tools available for conducting bibliometric and scientometric analyses, including the sources of data acquisition, performance analysis and visualization tools. The included tools were divided into three categories: general bibliometric and performance analysis, science mapping analysis, and libraries; a description of all of them is provided. A comparative analysis of the database sources support, pre-processing capabilities, analysis and visualization options were also provided in order to facilitate its understanding. Although there are numerous bibliometric databases to obtain data for bibliometric and scientometric analysis, they have been developed for a different purpose. The number of exportable records is between 500 and 50,000 and the coverage of the different science fields is unequal in each database. Concerning the analyzed tools, Bibliometrix contains the more extensive set of techniques and suitable for practitioners through Biblioshiny. VOSviewer has a fantastic visualization and is capable of loading and exporting information from many sources. SciMAT is the tool with a powerful pre-processing and export capability. In views of the variability of features, the users need to decide the desired analysis output and chose the option that better fits into their aims.",

A network visualisation tool VOSviewer was used to present authorship correlation network strength and keyword mapping for a better insight into the emerging areas in the field of SDL. The resulting average degree of collaboration of 0.898 indicates that a large number of publications are multi-authored and that there is a higher level of collaborative research in the field of semantic digital libraries. Meghini C from the Institute of Information Science and Technologies, Italy has produced the highest number of research paper(n=18) whereas Egenhofer MJ found to be a profoundly impacted author with 851 citations on in the studied domain. Results also reveal that the focus areas of research related to SDL include digital libraries, semantic web, ontology, metadata and information retrieval. However, keywords such as natural language processing system, computational linguistics, linked data are also repeated frequently in the published literature, thus revealing the emerging areas of the future research in the domain of SDL.",

        "Abstract": "The world is already into the information age. The huge growth of digital data has overwhelmed the traditional systems and approaches. Big data is touching almost all aspects of our life and the data-driven discovery approach is an emerging paradigm for computing. The ever-growing data provides a tidal wave of opportunities and challenges in terms of data capture, storage, manipulation, management, analysis, knowledge extraction, security, privacy and visualisation. Though the promise of big data seems to be genuine, still a wide gap exists between its potential and realisation. In last few years, there is a huge surge in research efforts in academia as well as industry to have a better understanding of big data. This article discusses the following: (1) big data evolution including a bibliometric study of academic and industry publications pertaining to big data during the period 2000\u20132017, (2) popular open-source big data stream processing frameworks and (3) prevalent research challenges which must be addressed to realise the true potential of big data.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to examine the trends and themes in the field of customer experience using a bibliometric analysis between 1957 and 2017. Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyses 1,767 papers selected from Web of Science (WoS) database using VOS Viewer software tool to create bibliometric networks. The results of the study were classified under the following bibliometric indicators: evaluation of the number of studies analyzed; most cited documents; most influential authors; and highly influential journals, institutions and countries with the highest productivity. Additionally, the paper also presents three co-citation studies analyzing most co-cited references, first authors and journals. Findings: Authors and institutes from the American and European countries dominate the contribution to the development of the field. The presence of Asian countries signifies the rising importance being given to the research field. The findings establish the argument that most of the ideas that follow today in the development of the field are mostly sourced from the works published in highly reputed journals. Co-citation analysis indicates the presence of multi-disciplinarity in the research field with journals representing different research areas such as management, strategy and psychology. Research limitations/implications: The papers analyzed in the study were retrieved only from the WoS. Furthermore, the precise number of clusters obtained during the analysis depends on the parameter set by the authors which is subjective. Researchers are encouraged to draw further insights by manipulating the parameter criteria. Practical implications: The findings in the study can be used to enrich the understanding of customer experience and future research on the topic. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is one of the first comprehensive papers offering a general overview of the leading trends in the field over a period of 60 years.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: The research mainly aims at the hotspot of inventory management by knowledge mapping and provides a visualization reference in this research field. Design/methodology/approach: First, inventory management journals during 1986 to 2017 were selected as the research object and text formatting in the Web of Science (WOS) database is exported. Then inventory management knowledge mapping is done and clustering keywords are extracted by using CiteSpace and VOSviewer software. Based on co-word analysis, the three special clusters are exported: inventory optimization strategy, inventory pricing and inventory technology. Besides, the clustering structure and time evolution are analysed. Finally, bibliographic item co-occurrence matrix builder (BICOMB) was used to extract the \"journal\" and \"researchers\" keywords in the inventory management research fields. Setting three parameters such as the cited half-life, centrality, frequency and keywords for data mining, it can infer the trend keywords of future research. Findings: Results showed that inventory management research has been abundant in literature over the past 30 years and has experienced a change from focusing on inventory optimization strategy to inventory pricing and inventory technology in process. It shows that inventory management research focused on the classic topics and includes economic order quantity, dynamic pricing, design and technology, and the new topics include channel coordination, hierarchical price and simulation. Research limitations/implications: Based on knowledge mapping, this study is still relatively macro and cannot cover all areas of inventory management. This study only investigated the state of correlational research in WOS and Google Trends and not additional databases. Originality/value: The current research mainly builds on knowledge mapping for the research hotspot of inventory management and provides visual references for future research in this field.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes how semantic indexing can help to generate a contextual overview of topics and visually compare clusters of articles. The method was originally developed for an innovative information exploration tool, called Ariadne, which operates on bibliographic databases with tens of millions of records (Koopman et al. in Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems. doi:, 2015b). In this paper, the method behind Ariadne is further developed and applied to the research question of the special issue 'Same data, different results'-the better understanding of topic (re-)construction by different bibliometric approaches. For the case of the Astro dataset of 111,616 articles in astronomy and astrophysics, a new instantiation of the interactive exploring tool, LittleAriadne, has been created. This paper contributes to the overall challenge to delineate and define topics in two different ways. First, we produce two clustering solutions based on vector representations of articles in a lexical space. These vectors are built on semantic indexing of entities associated with those articles. Second, we discuss how LittleAriadne can be used to browse through the network of topical terms, authors, journals, citations and various cluster solutions of the Astro dataset. More specifically, we treat the assignment of an article to the different clustering solutions as an additional element of its bibliographic record. Keeping the principle of semantic indexing on the level of such an extended list of entities of the bibliographic record, LittleAriadne in turn provides a visualization of the context of a specific clustering solution. It also conveys the similarity of article clusters produced by different algorithms, hence representing a complementary approach to other possible means of comparison.",

Design/methodology/approach: Of the top 100 universities listed in the QS World University Rankings in 2017, 76 libraries were selected as samples and a website investigation was conducted to explore the research support services. The statistical method and visualization software was used to generalize the key services, and the text analysis and case analysis were applied to reveal the corresponding implementation. Findings: Research support service has become one of the significant services of academic libraries in the context of e-research and data-intensive research. The research support services can be generally divided into seven aspects, as follows: research data management (62, 81.58 per cent), open access (64, 84.21 per cent), scholarly publishing (59, 77.63 per cent), research impact measurement (32, 42.11 per cent), research guides (47, 61.84 per cent), research consultation (59, 77.63 per cent) and research tools recommendation (38, 50.00 per cent). Originality/value: This paper makes a comprehensive investigation of research support services in academic libraries of top-ranking universities worldwide. The findings will help academic libraries improve research support services; thus, advancing the work of researchers and promoting scientific discovery.",

        "Abstract": "Based on real-world user demands, we demonstrate how animated visualization of evolving text corpora displays the underlying dynamics of semantic content. To interpret the results, one needs a dynamic theory of word meaning. We suggest that conceptual dynamics as the interaction between kinds of intellectual and emotional content and language is key for such a theory. We demonstrate our method by two-way seriation, which is a popular technique to analyze groups of similar instances and their features as well as the connections between the groups themselves. The two-way seriated data may be visualized as a two-dimensional heat map or as a three-dimensional landscape in which color codes or height correspond to the values in the matrix. In this article, we focus on two-way seriation of sparse data in the Reuters-21568 test collection. To achieve a meaningful visualization, we introduce a compactly supported convolution kernel similar to filter kernels used in image reconstruction and geostatistics. This filter populates the high-dimensional sparse space with values that interpolate nearby elements and provides insight into the clustering structure. We also extend two-way seriation to deal with online updates of both the row and column spaces and, combined with the convolution kernel, demonstrate a three-dimensional visualization of dynamics.",

It aims to explore the characteristics and rules of scientific communication in social media under emergency events, grasp the potential and risks of scientific communication in social media in special times and provide a perspective of academic communication for the scientific response. Design/methodology/approach: The authors select the enumeration data of the early COVID-19 theme papers spread on social media networks as the research object, apply descriptive statistical analysis to the basic statistical distribution of variables and use factor analysis and visualization methods to explore the law and characteristics of the spread of scientific papers on social media platforms. Findings: It was found that users of the COVID-19 paper are mainly in North America, Europe and South America, followed by those in East Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania. The users are mainly public figures, doctors and other practitioners, science communicators and scientists. The process of social media communication reflects three ways of knowledge construction, social interaction and academic communication, and there are three ways of communication law and changing trend of cross transition and integration. Originality/value: This study observes the function and role of science communication in social media in a special period from a unique perspective of academic communication, so as to promote academic means to fight against the epidemic.",

The way documents are indexed plays an important role in retrieval. The authors demonstrate the influence of different indexing characteristics on document space density (DSD) changes and document space discriminative capacity for IR. Document environments that contain a relatively higher percentage of infrequently occurring terms provide lower density outcomes than do environments where a higher percentage of frequently occurring terms exists. Different indexing exhaustivity levels, however, have little influence on the document space densities. A weighting algorithm that favors higher weights for infrequently occurring terms results in the lowest overall document space densities, which allows documents to be more readily differentiated from one another. This in turn can positively influence IR. The authors also discuss the influence on outcomes using two methods of normalization of term weights (i.e., means and ranges) for the different weighting methods.",

It has also been employed in knowledge management and information retrieval. We propose an alternative to existing 2-dimensional SOM based methods for document analysis. The method, termed Adaptive Topological Tree Structure (ATTS), generates a taxonomy of underlying topics from a set of unclassified, unstructured documents. The ATTS consists of a hierarchy of adaptive self-organising chains, each of which is validated independently using a proposed entropy-based Bayesian information criterion. A node meeting the expansion criterion spans a child chain, with reduced vocabulary and increased specialisation. The ATTS creates a topological tree of topics, which can be browsed like a content hierarchy and reflects the connections between related topics at each level. A review is also given on the existing neural network based methods for document clustering and organisation. Experimental results on real-world datasets using the proposed ATTS method are presented and compared with other approaches. The results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed validation criteria and the efficiency of the ATTS approach for document organisation, visualisation and search. It shows that the proposed methods not only improve the clustering results but also boost the retrieval.",

Three eye tracking experiments that we undertook are discussed and compared to additional work in this area, revealing recurring behaviors and trends. The first two studies are described in greater detail in Granka, Joachims, & Gay (2004), Lorigo et al. (2006), and Pan et al. (2007), and the third study is described for the first time in this article. These studies reveal how users view the ranked results on a search engine results page (SERP), the relationship between the search result abstracts viewed and those clicked on, and whether gender, search task, or search engine influence these behaviors. In addition, we discuss a key challenge that arose in all three studies that applies to the use of eye tracking in studying online behaviors which is due to the limited support for analyzing scanpaths, or sequences of eye fixations. To meet this challenge, we present a preliminary approach that involves a graphical visualization to compare a path with a group of paths. We conclude by summarizing our findings and discussing future work in further understanding online search behavior with the help of eye tracking.",

        "Abstract": "It cannot be overemphasized that changes in concepts have far more impact than new discoveries (Mayr, 1997, p. 98) Concept theory is an extremely broad, interdisciplinary and complex field of research related to many deep fields with very long historical traditions without much consensus. However, information science and knowledge organization cannot avoid relating to theories of concepts. Knowledge organizing systems (e.g., classification systems, thesauri, and ontologies) should be understood as systems basically organizing concepts and their semantic relations. The same is the case with information retrieval systems. Different theories of concepts have different implications for how to construe, evaluate, and use such systems. Based on \u201ca post-Kuhnian view\u201d of paradigms, this article put forward arguments that the best understanding and classification of theories of concepts is to view and classify them in accordance with epistemological theories (empiricism, rationalism, historicism, and pragmatism). It is also argued that the historicist and pragmatist understandings of concepts are the most fruitful views and that this understanding may be part of a broader paradigm shift that is also beginning to take place in information science. The importance of historicist and pragmatic theories of concepts for information science is outlined.",

        "Abstract": "A large amount of biomedical and genomic data are currently available on the Internet. However, data are distributed into heterogeneous biological information sources, with little or even no organization. Semantic technologies provide a consistent and reliable basis with which to confront the challenges involved in the organization, manipulation and visualization of data and knowledge. One of the knowledge representation techniques used in semantic processing is the ontology, which is commonly defined as a formal and explicit specification of a shared conceptualization of a domain of interest. The work presented here introduces a set of interoperable algorithms that can use domain and ontological information to improve information-retrieval processes. This work presents an ontology-based information-retrieval system for the biomedical domain. This system, with which some experiments have been carried out that are described in this paper, is based on the use of domain ontologies for the creation and normalization of lightweight ontologies that represent user preferences in a determined domain in order to improve information-retrieval processes.",

Two design conditions (symbolic vs non-symbolic) were used to evaluate users' ability to locate a place of interest. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 19 students (10 male and 9 female, 20-23 years old) participated in this study. The time required for subjects to find a place in the two conditions was used to estimate their searching performance. An electroencephalogram (EEG) device was used to examine students' cognitive load using event-related desynchronization percentages of alpha, beta and theta brain wave rhythms. Findings: The results showed that subjects needed more time to find a place in the non-symbolic condition than the symbolic condition. The EEG data, however, revealed that users experienced higher cognitive load when searching for a place in the symbolic condition. The authors found that the design characteristics of the map significantly influenced users' brain activity, thus impacting their search performance. Originality/value: Outcomes from this study can be used by cartographic designers and scholars to understand how certain design characteristics can trigger cognitive activity to improve users' searching experience and efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explain the rise of geospatial data, its importance for business and some of the problems associated with its development and use. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews a certain amount of previously published literature but is based mainly on analysis of the very large number of responses to a consultation paper on geospatial data published by the UK Government. Findings: The findings are that while there is strong appreciation of the potential benefits of using geospatial data, there are many barriers to the development, sharing and use of geospatial data, ranging from problems of incompatibility in data definitions and systems to regulatory issues. The implication for governments and for providers and users of geospatial data relates to the need to take a long-term approach to planning in resolving the issues identified. Research limitations/implications: The research findings are limited to the UK, but similar findings would be likely in any other large Western country. Practical implications: This paper confirms the need for a strong and coherent approach to the planning of geospatial data and systems for the establishment of a clear basis for the different parties to work together and the need to clearly separate the roles of the government in establishing frameworks and standards and the role of the private sector in developing applications and solutions. Social implications: Society is increasingly dependent on the use of geospatial data, in improving living standards and dealing with social problems. The recommendations identified in this paper, if followed, will facilitate these improvements. Originality/value: The value of this paper is the tight synthesis that it provides of a wide ranging and complex range of responses to the UK Government consultation and placing these responses in the wider context of the development of geospatial data.",

The data set used comprises full-text research articles published in four top-tier library and information science (LIS) journals from 2011 to 2018. It finds that in-text frequency-weighted counting performs as well as traditional counting in identifying major dimensions of the LIS field but also shows more detail. Re-citation-based counting appears to highlight well-integrated specialties and weaken the presence of more fragmented ones compared to traditional counting. In-text frequency weighted re-citation counting, expected to highlight \"deep\" impact, appears to effectively zoom into the field to show intense streams of research within it, but fail to identify major dimensions of the field, essentially providing a telescopic view of the LIS field instead of the panoramic one that the other three methods provide. Measuring deep impact may be interesting and important for research evaluation but fails to retain the broader context that makes the visualizations of research fields so informative. It appears that what may be \"noise\" when considering impact of individuals can provide the context that allows us to see the forest for the trees when examining intellectual structures of research fields as in the case of traditional ACA.",

Nearly seven thousand publications, which comprise the entirety of retractions visible through PubMed as of August 2019, were used. This work involved sophisticated data collection and analysis techniques to use data from PubMed, Wikipedia, and WikiData, and study it with respect to the above mentioned axes. Importantly, I employ state-of-the-art analysis and visualization techniques from natural language processing (NLP) to understand the topics in retracted literature. To highlight a few results, the analyses demonstrate an increasing rate of retraction over time and noticeable differences in the publication quality (as measured by journal impact factor) among top countries. Moreover, while molecular biology and cancer dominate retractions, we also see a number of retractions not related to biology. The methods and results of this study can be applied to continuously understand the nature and evolution of retractions in life sciences, thus contributing to the health of this research ecosystem.",

The results showed that with a high contribution to the field and a scientific collaboration with other related journals, JASSS had found its way in the field of social simulation and achieved an academic level. This study provides a reference for future studies by exploring the knowledge structures and publishing trends of JASSS. The bibliometrics analysis and visualization of JASSS can be a useful for either library and information science (LIS) scholars or the people interested in bibliometric studies; therefore, they can use it as a pattern to review other journals.",

A Home-monitoring system which uses modern sensor technologies was developed for and used in these field studies. It was installed in living environments of seven people (three who were not in need of care, two in need of care, and two with mental disabilities). The data were generated by sensor data acquisition and questionnaire reporting. Four types of data analysis and representation were evaluated to support caregivers. Results show that sensor data can be used to determine information directly or indirectly, which can be mapped to relevant assessment items and presented with different degrees of granularity. It is also feasible to determine and present additional information of potential interest which cannot be directly mapped to any assessment item. Sensor data can also be displayed in a live view. This live data representation led to a decrease in the caregivers' workload when assessed according to the German version of the Perceived Stress Questionnaire.",

        "Abstract": "Serendipity is the making of fortunate discoveries by accident, and is one of the cornerstones of scientific progress. In today's world of digital data and media, there is now a vast quantity of material that we could potentially encounter, and so there is an increased opportunity of being able to discover interesting things. However, the availability of material does not imply that we will be able to actually find it; the sheer quantity of data mitigates against us being able to discover the interesting nuggets. This paper explores approaches we have taken to support users in their search for interesting and relevant information. The primary concept is the principle that it is more useful to augment user skills in information foraging than it is to try and replace them. We have taken a variety of artificial intelligence, statistical, and visualisation techniques, and combined them with careful design approaches to provide supportive systems that monitor user actions, garner additional information from their surrounding environment and use this enhanced understanding to offer supplemental information that aids the user in their interaction with the system. We present two different systems that have been designed and developed according to these principles. The first system is a data mining system that allows interactive exploration of the data, allowing the user to pose different questions and understand information at different levels of detail. The second supports information foraging of a different sort, aiming to augment users browsing habits in order to help them surf the internet more effectively. Both use ambient intelligence techniques to provide a richer context for the interaction and to help guide it in more effective ways: both have the user as the focal point of the interaction, in control of an iterative exploratory process, working in indirect collaboration with the artificial intelligence components. Each of these systems contains some important concepts of their own: the data mining system has a symbolic genetic algorithm which can be tuned in novel ways to aid knowledge discovery, and which reports results in a user-comprehensible format. The visualisation system supports high-dimensional data, dynamically organised in a three-dimensional space and grouped by similarity. The notions of similarity are further discussed in the internet browsing system, in which an approach to measuring similarity between web pages and a user''s interests is presented. We present details of both systems and evaluate their effectiveness.",

Some emerging areas need to be addressed including information/digital literacy, research data management, data analysis and visualization and the skills to establish institutional repositories. Research limitations/implications: The study was limited to CPD literature contributed by Pakistani researchers and the efforts taken by LIS schools and professional associations. Originality/value: There is an immediate need to initiate a cohesive approach involving key stakeholders and to establish a platform purely working for CPD of librarians and information professionals focusing on current and future needs.

This article explains how semantic technology has been exploited to generate a centralized repository of personal activity context. This data drives advanced features such as personal situation recognition and customizable rules for the context-sensitive management of personal devices and data sharing.

        "Abstract": "In this paper, a generic framework for historical manuscript image and data processing, visualisation and analysis is introduced with a focus on the modelling of manuscript metadata underpinning the interaction. The goal of such a framework is to capture the requirements from three types of activities involving historical manuscripts: presentation, management and analysis. In addition to an overall text-based description of an historical manuscript, a central requirement of such a framework is to associate rich media information (e.g. video, flash component, etc.) to the manuscript or a specific region of the manuscript. A second requirement is to enable interchange of the manuscript data as well as the attached information between users. As a result of an extensive analysis of requirements collected across a wide range of target user groups, an XML-based metadata language derived from a relational database model is proposed to form an historical document data model, and a prototype system is developed to demonstrate some of the advanced functionalities enabled by this data model. Thus, the proposed framework provides an important tool in promoting access to historical documents on a wide and diverse basis, embracing the fundamental principles of universal access to a shared cultural heritage.",

To demonstrate this method, it is applied to classify the social science network in terms of aggregated journal-journal citation relations of the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Journal Citation Reports. This method of network classification is shown to be efficient, with a processing time that is linear to network size. The classification results provide an in-depth view of the network structure at various scales of resolution. For the social science network, there are 4 resolution scales, including 294 batches of journals at the highest scale, 65 categories of journals at the second, 15 research groups at the third scale, and 3 knowledge domains at the lowest resolution. By comparing the relatedness of journals within clusters, we show that our clustering method gives a better classification of social science journals than ISI's heuristic approach and hierarchical clustering. In combination with the minimum spanning tree approach and multi-dimensional scaling, MSC is also used to investigate the general structure of the network and construct a map of the social science network for visualization.",

With around 2.5 million new research contributions every year, researchers drown in a flood of pseudo-digitized PDF publications. As a result research is seriously weakened. In this article, we argue for representing scholarly contributions in a structured and semantic way as a knowledge graph. The advantage is that information represented in a knowledge graph is readable by machines and humans. As an example, we give an overview on the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), a service implementing this approach. For creating the knowledge graph representation, we rely on a mixture of manual (crowd/expert sourcing) and (semi-)automated techniques. Only with such a combination of human and machine intelligence, we can achieve the required quality of the representation to allow for novel exploration and assistance services for researchers. As a result, a scholarly knowledge graph such as the ORKG can be used to give a condensed overview on the state-of-the-art addressing a particular research quest, for example as a tabular comparison of contributions according to various characteristics of the approaches. Further possible intuitive access interfaces to such scholarly knowledge graphs include domain-specific (chart) visualizations or answering of natural language questions.",

Although laboratory user studies are the most common method for empirically validating the utility of information visualization and information retrieval systems such as this, it is difficult to determine if such studies accurately reflect the tasks of real users. This paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A longitudinal user evaluation was conducted in two phases over a ten-week period to determine how this novel web search interface was being used and accepted in real-world settings. Findings \u2013 Although the interactive features were not used as extensively as expected, there is evidence that the participants did find them useful. Participants were able to refine their queries easily, although most did so manually. Those that used the interactive exploration features were able to effectively discover potentially relevant documents buried deep in the search results list. Subjective reactions regarding the usefulness and ease-of-use of the system were positive, and more than half of the participants continued to use the system even after the study ended. Originality/value \u2013 As a result of conducting this longitudinal study, the author has gained a deeper understanding of how a particular visual and interactive web search interface is being used in the real world, as well as issues associated with resistance to change. These findings may provide guidance for the design, development, and study of next generation interfaces for online information retrieval.",

        "Abstract": "Decades ago, increased volume of data made manual analysis obsolete and prompted the use of computational tools with interactive user interfaces and rich palette of data visualizations. Yet their classic, desktop-based architectures can no longer cope with the ever-growing size and complexity of data. Next-generation systems for explorative data analysis will be developed on client-server architectures, which already run concurrent software for data analytics but are not tailored to for an engaged, interactive analysis of data and models. In explorative data analysis, the key is the responsiveness of the system and prompt construction of interactive visualizations that can guide the users to uncover interesting data patterns. In this study, we review the current software architectures for distributed data analysis and propose a list of features to be included in the next generation frameworks for exploratory data analysis. The new generation of tools for explorative data analysis will need to address integrated data storage and processing, fast prototyping of data analysis pipelines supported by machine-proposed analysis workflows, pre-emptive analysis of data, interactivity, and user interfaces for intelligent data visualizations. The systems will rely on a mixture of concurrent software architectures to meet the challenge of seamless integration of explorative data interfaces at client site with management of concurrent data mining procedures on the servers.

        "Abstract": "Scientific datasets are often difficult to analyse or visualize, due to their large size and high dimensionality. A multistep approach to address this problem is proposed. Data management techniques are used to identify areas of interest within the dataset. This allows the reduction of a dataset's size and dimensionality, and the estimation of missing values or correction of erroneous entries. The results are displayed using visualization techniques based on perceptual rules. The visualization tools are designed to exploit the power of the low-level human visual system. The result is a set of displays that allow users to perform rapid and accurate exploratory data analysis. In order to demonstrate the techniques, an environmental dataset being used to model salmon growth and migration patterns was visualized. Data mining was used to identify significant attributes and to provide accurate estimates of plankton density. Colour and texture were used to visualize the significant attributes and estimated plankton densities for each month for the years 1956-1964. Experiments run in the laboratory showed that the chosen colours and textures support rapid and accurate element identification, boundary detection, region tracking and estimation. The result is a visualization tool that allows users to quickly locate specific plankton densities and the boundaries they form. Users can compare plankton densities to other environmental conditions like sea surface temperature and current strength. Finally, users can track changes in any of the dataset's attributes on a monthly or yearly basis.",

Integrating PGHD into electronic health records (EHRs) further expands the capacities to monitor patients' health status without requiring office visits or hospitalizations. By reviewing and discussing PGHD with patients remotely, clinicians could address the clinical issues efficiently outside of clinical settings. However, EHR-integrated PGHD may create a burden for clinicians, leading to burnout. This study aims to investigate how interactions with EHR-integrated PGHD may result in clinician burnout. We identify the potential contributing factors to clinician burnout using\u00a0a modified FITT (Fit between Individuals, Task and Technology) framework. We\u00a0found that technostress, time pressure, and workflow-related issues need to be addressed to accelerate the integration of PGHD into clinical care. The roles of artificial intelligence, algorithm-based clinical decision support, visualization format, human-computer interaction mechanism, workflow optimization, and financial reimbursement in reducing burnout are highlighted.",

        "Abstract": "The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has facilitated the release of large amounts of government information that has been of great value to researchers, journalists, and other interested parties. The fraction of this information released in electronic format has been growing as has its volume. While offering great potential for research, large amounts of data disgorged from government information systems can pose challenges to human interpretation and knowledge extraction. Using the Office of the Secretary of Defense/Joint Staff Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Logs for 2007-2009, this research identifies (1) a process for finding relationships between the FOIA requests through keywords extracted from Wikipedia and (2) a technique for visualizing these relationships in order to provide context and improve understanding when working with born-digital government data.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: Local cultural heritage document repositories are characterized by contents strongly attached to a territory (i.e. geographical references). The user must be able to consider such repositories according to a focus, which takes into account his/her geographical interests, and which allows one to access the relevant document''s contents from a geographical point of view. This paper presents the Virtual Itineraries in the Pyrenees (PIV) project. Spatial and temporal core models are proposed to give a formal representation of geographical information. The models take into account the characteristics of heterogeneous human modes of expression: written language and captures of drawings, maps, pictures, etc. Semantic processes have been built to automatically manage the spatial and temporal information from non-structured data. A \u201cback office\u201d prototype, which adds these processes to classic information extraction (IE) approaches, while associating a geographical information retrieval (GIR) service is proposed. This service searches for any links between formal representations of geographic information in document collections, and similar representations in a user''s information query. Finally, the paper presents the design work, giving the details of the principles of result visualization and navigation, while proposing a \u201cfront office\u201d first implementation of the system.",

        "Abstract": "Geospatial data users increasingly face the need to assess how datasets fit an intended use. However, information describing data quality is typically difficult to access and understand. Therefore, data quality is often neglected by users, leading to risks of misuse. Understanding data quality is a complex task that may involve thousands of partially related metadata. For complex cases where heterogeneous datasets have to be integrated, there is a need for tools supporting data quality analysis. This paper presents the design of such a tool that can manage heterogeneous data quality information and provide functions to support expert users in the assessment of the fitness for use of a given dataset. Combining concepts from GIS and Business Intelligence, this approach provides interactive, multi-granularity and context-sensitive spatial data quality indicators that help experts to build and justify their opinions. A prototype called the Multidimensional User Manual is presented to illustrate this approach.",

Patent information is presented and recorded in a very systematic manner which simplifies the task of searching relevant information for various purposes like technology forecasting. Patent documents help in drawing a baseline, identifying vacuums and then providing leads to fill these vacuums. The present paper is focused on finding patent documents as leads for an R&D problem, utilising various tools pertaining to patent literature including patent searching, text mining, and patent analysis to zero down the key patent documents as leads. A practical R&D problem related to the development of a drug delivery device for releasing the vapours of drug was imposed by scientists for which a systematic search was performed to extract most relevant patent documents using various patent analytical tools towards solving a practical R & D problem.",

There was sufficient experience that ACA would work with almost any user data that lent itself to co-occurrence. While most of the current researches still relied on the data of scientific literatures. In this study, in order to provide useful information for better enterprise management, the idea and method of ACA was applied to analyze the information interaction intensity and contents of enterprise web users. Firstly, the development of ACA was briefly introduced. Then the sample data and method used in this study were given. Three QQ groups' instant messages of a Chinese company were selected as the raw data and the concepts and model of user interaction intensity (UII) were proposed by referring the ACA theory. Social network analysis method, combined with in-deep interview method were used to analyze the information interaction intensity and contents of enterprise users. Operatively, Excel, Ucinet, Pajek, Netdraw and VOSviewer software were combined to analyze them quantitatively and visually. Finally, it concluded that UII model was relatively reasonable and it could nicely measure the information interaction intensity and contents of enterprise web users.",

An experimental study provided evidence that information visualizations support knowledge acquisition. In addition, with regard to the appropriate design, the empirical results showed that two-dimensional information visualizations are better suited for supporting processes of knowledge acquisition than three-dimensional ones and that color-coded information visualizations slightly increase performance in a knowledge test compared to monochromatic ones.",

Transforming millions of \"data bits\" to intelligence for better decision making remains a challenge.

Classification schemes, search techniques, retrieval methods, delivery speed, and storage capacity have all increased exponentially. The key forces contributing to such transformation were public-private cooperation, the dedication of pioneers who \"grew the field,\" and the entrepreneurial ventures of data consolidators and research agencies. The social, economic, and organizational forces brought about changes that were coupled widi the requisite technology; diis paved the way for the creation of the Internet, the World Wide Web, and many related features that range from mobile communication to visualization techniques.",

To address this question, library staff developed a collaborative, multi-tool process for bibliometric analysis and network visualization. The primary data source used was a preexisting, curated EndNote library of institutional publications. This EndNote library was searched using keywords relevant to the topic in order to create two sublibraries: one on pain and one specifically on musculoskeletal pain. Article data from each library were exported into InCites to create a benchmarking analysis. In addition, article data were imported into VOSviewer to visualize collaboration networks by author and create concept maps. Researchers were consulted to identify and label resulting clusters in the VOSviewer visualizations. This project successfully generated useful visualizations via bibliometric mapping that characterized current and potential pain research at the institution. The analysis was included in a grant proposal for funding a center for pain research and for catalyzing further collaborative research.",

        "Abstract": "ActiveGraph is an information visualization tool designed to provide users with a concise, customizable view of objects in a digital library. A set of digital library objects is represented as a data set in a two- or three-dimensional scatter plot. The data set can represent any digital library objects in any medium: books, journals, papers, images, Web resources, or even entire databases. Since ActiveGraph is intended for use in the context of digital libraries, data attributes consist for the most part of metadata fields such as title, author, date of publication, and number of citations. Data attributes are mapped to six visual attributes of the scatter plot: the X-, Y-, and Z-axes, color, size, and shape. The metadata for a selected data point are displayed in a control panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Users can edit the metadata and even add new metadata fields. Thus ActiveGraph allows users to both view and customize the contents of a library. Because of its flexibility in handling digital library objects and metadata of different types, ActiveGraph can be used in a variety of digital library applications. In this paper, we describe two: LibGraph, which is a visualization of a collaborative library, and CiteGraph, which is a visualization of citation statistics. Both applications were designed for use by scientists and engineers, for whom scatter plots are familiar and intuitive visualizations.",

Based on a year-long transaction log file, five medical focus keywords (stomach, hip, stroke, depression, and cholesterol) and their co-occurring query terms are analyzed. An overlap-coefficient similarity measure and a conversion measure are used to calculate the proximity of terms to one another based on their co-occurrences in queries. The impact of the dimensionality of the visual configuration, the cutoff point of term co-occurrence for inclusion in the analysis, and the Minkowski metric power k on the stress value are discussed. A visual clustering of groups of terms based on the proximity within each focus-keyword group is also conducted. Term distributions within each visual configuration are characterized and are compared with formal medical vocabulary. This investigation reveals that there are significant differences between consumer health query-term usage and more formal medical terminology used by medical professionals when describing the same medical subject. Future directions are discussed.",

This is made possible using the web sites of industrial property official entities, with the support of information resources available through libraries and information services in universities, and their available information resources, which will be crucial for the success of university research centres (URC) in Science, Technology and Medicine (STM). In order to achieve a coherent program of dissemination and enable access to patent information by the URC, social media network tools (such as RSS, Blogs, Wikis, Newsletters) will be used to achieve the proposed objectives, as well as control effectively, in order to constantly improve the system implemented. The goal of this technology watch and competitive intelligence is to stimulate creativity, leading to new product/process development and the consequent improvement of innovation rates in academic research institutions with cost efficiency. Some examples of the use and application of this information resource in different types of industry and a model created for its dissemination will be presented.",

        "Abstract": "Objective To visualize and describe collaborative electronic health record (EHR) usage for hospitalized patients with heart failure. Materials and methods We identified records of patients with heart failure and all associated healthcare provider record usage through queries of the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse. We constructed a network by equating access and updates of a patient's EHR to a provider-patient interaction. We then considered shared patient record access as the basis for a second network that we termed the provider collaboration network. We calculated network statistics, the modularity of provider interactions, and provider cliques. Results We identified 548 patient records accessed by 5113 healthcare providers in 2012. The provider collaboration network had 1504 nodes and 83 998 edges. We identified 7 major provider collaboration modules. Average clique size was 87.9 providers. We used a graph database to demonstrate an ad hoc query of our provider-patient network. Discussion Our analysis suggests a large number of healthcare providers across a wide variety of professions access records of patients with heart failure during their hospital stay. This shared record access tends to take place not only in a pairwise manner but also among large groups of providers. Conclusion EHRs encode valuable interactions, implicitly or explicitly, between patients and providers. Network analysis provided strong evidence of multidisciplinary record access of patients with heart failure across teams of 100+ providers. Further investigation may lead to clearer understanding of how record access information can be used to strategically guide care coordination for patients hospitalized for heart failure.",

        "Abstract": "Digital competences, computer skills, information literacy and related abilities represent a crucial element in ICT education (Information and Communication Technologies). They are less frequently investigated in the frame of secondary education than in higher education. We assess these contexts in secondary education through science mapping and visualizing techniques, examining publishing patterns and trends. Databases Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus are used. Publishing exhibits logarithmic inverse relationship between rank and frequency (power laws). Only a few chief publications among hundreds account for an important share of all published research. WOS-based visualizations (VOSviewer software) of concepts used in titles, abstracts and keywords show several clusters of research: computer-, information-, as well as digital-related. Further analysis reveals that the major terms which define these clusters predominate in different periods. Computer-related are earlier terms, followed by information-related, and now digital-related. As some concepts mature terminology embraces more trendy novel concepts. Clusters of co-citing and co-cited sources shows differences among publications. Proceedings play an important role as sources of co-citations but are cited more weakly. Both co-citing and co-cited sources exhibit well defined clusters with little convergence between Library and Information Science on one side and Education and Educational Research, and Computer Science on the other even though the respective publications employ similar terminological concepts. The lack of exchange between these research domains calls for more co-operation in order to boost synergy in these critical twenty-first century skills.",

Though valuable, this strategy is reactive, fails to account for numerous environmental factors affecting personal health and falls short of enhancing human health on a broader scale. An unmet challenge with abundant opportunity lies in prevention informatics, a proactive approach drawing on information science and technologies to deliver greater health gains at a population level. Prevention informatics is marked by a high degree social interactivity in real time, with technologies to bring together disparate data and represent it in an integrated and meaningful way as the basis for action. The approach relies on standards for classifying information, systematic knowledge management and improved methods to collect, mine and visualize data. Tools and software are already in use in locations around the world, relying on smartphone technology and geographic information systems to share community health information and location data. Further advances in prevention informatics will require adoption of common terminologies, visualization tools and GIS mapping, and optimized data exchange to support rapid prevention response.",

It provides active user assistance by displaying options to broaden or narrow search. User evaluation showed Searchling to be easy to use, appealing broadly but especially to linear thinkers. The T-Saurus interface is more visual, with term search results represented by the size, number, proximity and opacity of buckets. Terms can be displayed in multiple languages simultaneously, and multiple terms can be chosen to form a query to retrieve documents. Visual thinkers appreciated its dynamic and interactive visualization interface.

Applying the proposed method to modeling citations to papers and scholars in the InfoVis 2004 data, a benchmark collection about a 31-year history of information visualization, leads to findings consistent with citation distributions in general and observations of the domain in particular. Fitness variables based on prior impacts and the time factor have significant influences on citation outcomes. We find considerably large effect sizes from the fitness modeling, which suggest inevitable bias in citation analysis due to these factors. While raw citation scores offer little insight into the growth of InfoVis, normalization of the scores by influences of time and prior fitness offers a reasonable depiction of the field's development. The analysis demonstrates the proposed model's ability to produce results consistent with observed data and to support meaningful comparison of citation scores over time.",

We present a framework where methods and tools from a set of disciplines, ranging from Semantic and Social Web to Natural Language Processing, provide us the building blocks for creating a semantic social space to organize artworks according to an ontology of emotions. The ontology is inspired by the Plutchik\u2019s circumplex model, a well-founded psychological model of human emotions. Users can be involved in the creation of the emotional space, through a graphical interactive interface. The development of such semantic space enables new ways of accessing and exploring art collections. The affective categorization model and the emotion detection output are encoded into W3C ontology languages. This gives us the twofold advantage to enable tractable reasoning on detected emotions and related artworks, and to foster the interoperability and integration of tools developed in the Semantic Web and Linked Data community. The proposal has been evaluated against a real-word case study, a dataset of tagged multimedia artworks from the ArsMeteo Italian online collection, and validated through a user study.",

Two-handed interaction using three-space magnetic trackers and stereoscopic viewing are combined to produce aminimally immersive interactive system that enhances the user's three-dimensional perception of the information space. This new system capitalizes on the human visual system's pre-attentive learning capabilities to quickly analyze the displayed information. SFA is integrated with a document management and information retrieval engine named Telltale. Together, these systems integrate visualization and document analysis technologies to solve the problem of analyzing large document corpora. We describe the usefulness of this system for the analysis and visualization of document similarity within acorpus of textual documents, and present an example exploring authorship of ancient Biblical texts.",

Since its inception in the early- to mid -1950s, it has grown as a result, in part, of well-regarded retrieval system evaluation exercises/campaigns, the proliferation of Web search engines, and the expansion of digital libraries. Although researchers have examined the intellectual structure and nature of the general field of library and information science, the same cannot be said about the subfield of information retrieval. We address that in this work by sketching the information retrieval intellectual landscape through visualizations of citation behaviors. Citation data for 10years (2000\u20132009) were retrieved from the Web of Science and analyzed using existing visualization techniques. Our results address information retrieval\u2019s co-authorship network, highly productive authors, highly cited journals and papers, author-assigned keywords, active institutions, and the import of ideas from other disciplines.",

        "Abstract": "The visual traffic sweeps (VTS) approach combines traditional observational methods for assessing library space with geographic information system (GIS) visualization techniques. This unique approach to spatial analysis can be used across library and information settings (or in other spaces with large amounts of human traffic) to map patterns in user behavior. Results of the visual analyses can be triangulated with other methods (e.g., questionnaires or interviews) to better inform library policy and space planning decisions. Findings from a study that used VTS in the business library of a large, urban university illustrate the potential application of this technique across library settings. Specific findings (e.g., patrons' preferences for certain spaces for laptop use, despite the library reserving other space for laptops) demonstrate the power of visualization techniques for analyzing results in ways that are not possible with standard statistical analysis approaches. In addition, the visual maps that result from the analysis process are useful for the presentation of visual data in conference presentations and/or to library stakeholders. Overall, this approach provides evidence for space planning decisions that are grounded in users' real activities within the library space.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Within the Dutch Child Health Care (CHC), an online tool (360\u00b0 CHILD-profile) is designed to enhance prevention and transformation toward personalized health care. From a personalized preventive perspective, it is of fundamental importance to timely identify children with emerging health problems interrelated to multiple health determinants. While digitalization of children's health data is now realized, the accessibility of data remains a major challenge for CHC professionals, let alone for parents/youth. Therefore, the idea was initiated from CHC practice to develop a novel approach to make relevant information accessible at a glance. Objective: This paper describes the stepwise development of a dashboard, as an example of using a design model to achieve visualization of a comprehensive overview of theoretically structured health data. Methods: Developmental process is based on the nested design model with involvement of relevant stakeholders in a real-life context. This model considers immediate upstream validation within 4 cascading design levels: Domain Problem and Data Characterization, Operation and Data Type Abstraction, Visual Encoding and Interaction Design, and Algorithm Design. This model also includes impact-oriented downstream validation, which can be initiated after delivering the prototype. Results: A comprehensible 360\u00b0 CHILD-profile is developed: an online accessible visualization of CHC data based on the theoretical concept of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. This dashboard provides caregivers and parents/youth with a holistic view on children's health and \"entry points\" for preventive, individualized health plans. Conclusions: Describing this developmental process offers guidance on how to utilize the nested design model within a health care context. JMIR Form Res 2021;5(2):e24061 doi:10.2196/24061",

        "Abstract": "Cities are restless systems. Increasing urbanisation and the cumulative growth of urban management issues are pressing local governments to provide valuable services. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are established as drivers of this new wave of change in the redefinition of the relationship between the city and its citizens. Smart Cities rely strongly on strategies and solutions enabled by ICTs involving directly local governments, citizens and communities. Open data alone, though a relevant component of these strategies, cannot provide enough incentives for the engagement of citizens necessary to establish a collaborative and open governance system; data need to be appropriately elaborated, communicated and used. The main objective of this paper is to investigate how open data together with simple and standardised elaborations and innovative visualisation techniques may be used to provide new and updated services to citizens and communities: free and readily available services based on the wealth of information \u2018owned\u2019 by local governments. Adopting a design science research methodology we develop and test a collaborative ICT-based tool called UrbanSense. We use it to highlight how systemic connections between citizens and city-government may be devised. On this point, the focus is on the feedforwarding of open data integrated with basic elaborations and visualisations as a means for the local government to create new and open services for citizens and communities. The use of the services prompts citizens to feedback new information in real-time to the city government. These interactions may be used to foster an open innovation ecosystem.",

        "Abstract": "The interactive use of visual interface tools has diversified the use of visualisations. This article reviews the relevant aspects of interaction and challenges the sufficiency of traditional evaluation criteria developed for static graphs. Traditionally, the problem for statisticians has been to maintain perceptual discriminability of details, when quantities of data increase. Currently, however, even non-professional users need to integrate qualitatively different kinds of information. The review of task requirements indicates the use of a visual outline: (1) visual tools can facilitate parallel separation of individual data entities and integration of their features and (2) more focused comparisons require visual memory due to eye movements. The article reports psychophysical experiments that measure performance accuracy and response latency conditioned by the above task requirements. The impact of shape and colour on performance interacted with display times; the times were shorter (100\u00a0ms) or longer (1 s) than the duration of typical gaze fixation. The features of graphs in the experiments were derived from a popular internet service. Thus, we describe methods for evaluating visual components of real services and provide general guidelines for visual design of human\u2013computer interaction.",

        "Abstract": "The ICT revolution of the last decades impacted scientific communication as it has impacted many other forms of communications, changing the way in which articles are delivered and how they can be discovered. However, the impact of ICT on the research itself has been much more profound, introducing digital tools to the way in which researchers gather data, perform analyses, and exchange results. This brought new, digital forms of research output, and disseminating those calls for changes deeply impact the core format of the scientific article. In 2009, Elsevier introduced the \"Article of the Future\" project to define an optimal way for the dissemination of science in the digital age, and in this paper we discuss three of its key dimensions. First we discuss interlinking scientific articles and research data stored with domain-specific data repositories -- such interlinking is essential to interpret both article and data efficiently and correctly. We then present easy-to-use 3D visualization tools embedded in online articles: a key example of how the digital article format adds value to scientific communication and helps readers to better understand research results. The last topic covered in this paper is automatic enrichment of journal articles through text-mining or other methods. Here we share insights from a recent survey on the question: how can we find a balance between creating valuable contextual links, without sacrificing the high-quality, peer-reviewed status of published articles?",

        "Abstract": "Objective: This bibliometric study investigated literature pertaining to a quickly growing population worldwide: the oldest-old, individuals age eighty-five and older. The current state of research was surveyed, based on top authors, publishers, authorship networks, themes in publication titles and abstracts, and highly cited publications. Methods: Bibliographic data was abstracted from the Web of Science database. Microsoft Excel was used for data analyses related to top author, publishers, and terms. VosViewer bibliographic visualization software was used to identify authorship networks. Results: Publications pertaining to the oldest-old have increased dramatically over the past three decades. The majority of these publications are related to medical or genetics topics. Citations for these publications remain relatively low but may be expected to grow in coming years, based on the publication behavior about and increasing prominence of this population. Claudio Franceschi and the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society were found to be the author and journal with the most publications pertaining to the oldest-old, respectively. Conclusions: The oldest-old is a population of rapidly growing significance. Researchers in library and information science, gerontology, and beyond can benefit themselves and those they serve by participating in research and specialized services to marginalized populations like the oldest-old. This bibliometric study hopefully serves as a launch-point for further inquiry and research in the years to come.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: Finding relevant information in a large and comprehensive collection of cross-referenced documents like Wikipedia usually requires a quite accurate idea where to look for the pieces of data being sought. A user might not yet have enough domain-specific knowledge to form a precise search query to get the desired result on the first try. Another problem arises from the usually highly cross-referenced structure of such document collections. When researching a subject, users usually follow some references to get additional information not covered by a single document. With each document, more opportunities to navigate are added and the structure and relations of the visited documents gets harder to understand. This paper describes the interactive visualization Wivi which enables users to intuitively navigate Wikipedia by visualizing the structure of visited articles and emphasizing relevant other topics. Combining this visualization with a view of the current article results in a custom browser specially adapted for exploring large information networks. By visualizing the potential paths that could be taken, users are invited to read up on subjects relevant to the current point of focus and thus opportunistically finding relevant information. Results from a user study indicate that this visual navigation can be easily used and understood. A majority of the participants of the study stated that this method of exploration supports them finding information in Wikipedia.",

'Organizationally real' digital representations are those that, beyond the mere capacity to, actually get woven into everyday work practices. Empirically, we draw on a four-year case study of offshore oil and gas production. Our case provides a vivid illustration of Internet of Things (IoT) based visualizations and data driven predictions characteristic for efforts of digitally transforming industrial process and manufacturing enterprises. We contribute by identifying and discussing three mechanisms through which digital representations become organizationally real: (i) noise reduction (the strategies and heuristics to filter out signal from noise), (ii) material tethering (grounding the digital representations to a corresponding physical measurement) and (iii) triangulating (in the absence of a direct correspondence, corroborating digital representations relative to other representations). \u2022 Extends insights into referent/reference relation through a process model for the becoming of digital representation \u2022 Highlights how digital sensors are vehicles for turning physical referents into digital representations \u2022 Explores how digital representations need to be incorporated into organizational practices to become organizationally real \u2022 Identifies and discusses three mechanisms through which digital representations become organizationally real",

Scientists with different curation roles (including that of end user) may focus on different data quality aspects and skill requirements in a community curation environment. This study examines how genomics scientists' perceived priorities for data quality and data quality skills differ when assuming different roles played in genomics data curation work. The analysis of survey data collected from 147 genomics scientists found that curators of genomics data valued quality criteria that can be assessed through direct examination of the data more highly, while end users placed a high value on the quality criteria that can be assessed indirectly, such as believability. With regard to data quality skills, curators appeared to care more about understanding user's requirements and specific data management skills than end users, while end users valued the skills needed to deal with information overload more highly \u2014 those needed to identify useful, relevant information from large amounts of data. Scientists with different curation roles, given common curation tasks with the same skill requirements, prioritized different data quality criteria. The data quality, skill priorities, and tradeoffs identified by this study can inform the development of effective data curation mandates and policies, data quality assurance planning and training, and the design of curation role specific tool dashboards and visualization interfaces for genomics data.",

As an example for these intended benefits for research data providers we will introduce two service components: the application preservation and the referencing of complex software environments. Jointly applied they enable researchers to archive and reference to complex representations of research data such as digital editions, virtual research environments, or data visualisations.",

The genomes of SARS-CoV-2 are being rapidly sequenced and shared on public repositories. To keep up with these updates, scientists need to frequently refresh and reclean data sets, which is an ad hoc and labor-intensive process. Further, scientists with limited bioinformatics or programming knowledge may find it difficult to analyze SARS-CoV-2 genomes.<bold>Objective: </bold>To address these challenges, we developed CoV-Seq, an integrated web server that enables simple and rapid analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.<bold>Methods: </bold>CoV-Seq is implemented in Python and JavaScript. The web server and source code URLs are provided in this article.<bold>Results: </bold>Given a new sequence, CoV-Seq automatically predicts gene boundaries and identifies genetic variants, which are displayed in an interactive genome visualizer and are downloadable for further analysis. A command-line interface is available for high-throughput processing. In addition, we aggregated all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and China National GeneBank (CNGB), and extracted genetic variants from these sequences for download and downstream analysis. The CoV-Seq database is updated weekly.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>We have developed CoV-Seq, an integrated web service for fast and easy analysis of custom SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The web server provides an interactive module for the analysis of custom sequences and a weekly updated database of genetic variants of all publicly accessible SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

It was developed as a free and open tool for partners of the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program. Its central goal is to reveal patterns within collections to lead to new understanding. Viewshare features a simple and intuitive interface and limited requirements for technical skills, and it supports a wide variety of digital collections and metadata types. Its users establish custom metadata, import and enhance collection data and create their own interface to support dynamic and interactive views of their digital collections. The process is illustrated with the Fulton Street Trade Card Collection from the Brooklyn Public Library.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Background: Attrition is a significant problem in Web-based interventions. Consequently, this research aims to identify the relation between Web usage and benefit from such interventions. A visualization tool has been developed that enables researchers to more easily examine large datasets on intervention usage that can be difficult to make sense of using traditional descriptive or statistical techniques alone. Objective: This paper demonstrates how the visualization tool was used to explore patterns in participants' use of a Web-based weight management intervention, termed \"positive online weight reduction (POWeR).\" We also demonstrate how the visualization tool can be used to perform subsequent statistical analyses of the association between usage patterns, participant characteristics, and intervention outcome. Methods: The visualization tool was used to analyze data from 132 participants who had accessed at least one session of the POWeR intervention. Results: There was a drop in usage of optional sessions after participants had accessed the initial, core POWeR sessions, but many users nevertheless continued to complete goal and weight reviews. The POWeR tools relating to the food diary and steps diary were reused most often. Differences in participant characteristics and usage of other intervention components were identified between participants who did and did not choose to access optional POWeR sessions (in addition to the initial core sessions) or reuse the food and steps diaries. Reuse of the steps diary and the getting support tools was associated with greater weight loss. Conclusions: The visualization tool provided a quick and efficient method for exploring patterns of Web usage, which enabled further analyses of whether different usage patterns were associated with participant characteristics or differences in intervention outcome. Further usage of visualization techniques is recommended to (1) make sense of large datasets more quickly and efficiently; (2) determine the likely active ingredients in Web-based interventions, and thereby enhance the benefit they may provide; and (3) guide in designing (or redesigning) of future interventions to promote greater use and engagement by enabling users to easily access valued intervention content/tools.

        "Abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing interest among statistical researchers to develop new probability distributions, adding one or more parameters to previously existing ones. In this article, we describe a bibliometric analysis carried out to show the evolution of various models based on the seminal model of (Marshall and Olkin, Biometrika. 1997). This method allows us to explore and analyze large volumes of scientific data through performance indicators to identify the main contributions of authors, universities, and journals in terms of productivity, citations, and bibliographic coupling. The analysis was performed using the Bibliometrix R-package tool. The sample of analyzed data was based on articles indexed in the main collection of the Web of Science and Scopus between 1997 and 2021. This work also includes an overview of the methodology used, the corresponding quantitative analyses, a visualization of networks of collaboration and co-citations, as well as a description of the topic trends. In total, 131 articles were analyzed, which were published in 67 journals. Two journals published 17% of the manuscripts analyzed in this work. We identified 238 separate authors who have participated in the development of this research topic. In 2020, 49% of the authors presented new distributions, where their proposed models included up to six parameters. The publications were grouped into 20 collaborative groups of which Groups 1 and 2 are dominant in the development of new models. Thus, 24% of the publications analyzed belong to two researchers who lead these two groups. To show the flexibility of the new distributions, the authors apply their models using at least two sets of real-world data to show their potentiality. This article gives a broad overview of different generalizations of the Marshall-Olkin model and will be of great help to those interested in this line of research.",

The purpose of this paper is to report the diversity of these pictorial metaphors, delineate their formal qualities as drawings, and provide a fresh perspective on the concept of information.Design/methodology/approach The project utilized pre-existing iSquare drawings of information that were produced by iSchool graduate students during a draw-and-write activity. From a data set of 417 images, 125 of the strongest pictorial metaphors were identified and subjected to cognitive metaphor theory.Findings Overwhelmingly, the favored source domain for envisioning information was nature. The most common pictorial metaphors were: Earth, web, tree, light bulb, box, cloud, and fishing/mining, and each brings different qualities of information into focus. The drawings were often canonical versions of objects in the world, leading to arrays of pictorial metaphors marked by their similarity.Research limitations/implications Less than 30 percent of the data set qualified as pictorial metaphors, making them a minority strategy for representing information as an image. The process to identify and interpret pictorial metaphors was highly subjective. The arts-informed methodology generated tensions between artistic and social scientific paradigms.Practical implications The pictorial metaphors for information can enhance information science education and fortify professional identity among information professionals.Originality/value This is the first arts-informed, visual study of information that utilizes cognitive metaphor theory to explore the nature of information. It strengthens a sense of history, humanity, nature, and beauty in our understanding of information today, and contributes to metaphor research at large.",

This paper depicts the characteristics of the Asian Innovation Networks for four main emerging technologies: 3D printing technology, big data technology, integrated circuit technology and carbon nanotubes and graphene technology. The networks' characteristics are presented by calculating the different network centrality indicators. In order to show these characteristics intuitively, the visualization method was also used. Both methods are based on an analysis of patents and patent data are collected from the European Patent Office (EPO) database. The results indicate that Japan ranks first in betweenness centrality, while China has the highest degree centrality among nearly all the emerging technologies. In the carbon nanotubes and graphene technology innovation network, India has tight interactions with South Korea, and Iran is closely related to Malaysia. Thailand plays an important role in the big data technology innovation network. The centrality trend for Asian countries in innovation networks has gradually decreased. This could be useful for developing Asian countries to make international scientific and technological collaboration strategies and policies in the future.",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Children between the ages of seven and 11 were observed as they browsed either a 2D or 3D navigation interface for a children\u2019s digital library. Data regarding their use of the overview function and depth cues were analyzed to reveal the relationships between search performance efficiency, precision, and effectiveness and the associative memory, visualization memory, and spatial visualization abilities of the user. Findings \u2013 Children spent less time using the 2D interface when compared to time spent using the 3D interface. Children exhibited better performance precision when using the 3D interface. Children applied exhaustive strategies and more varied cognitive skills across different tasks when using the 2D interface, and applied a more focussed approach when using the 3D interface. Originality/value \u2013 The cognitive abilities of children are not yet fully developed, so they require a unique user interface when browsing digital libraries. This study served the practical purpose of developing a game-like user interface for ease of use. Providing an effective overview function allows young users with less developed cognitive abilities to navigate informational cues. They can then build an effective mind map and implement efficient way-finding strategies.",

Evidence shows that visual intelligence predicts adequate interaction patterns and that two dimensions of mood - high tense arousal and anger/frustration - negatively affect the interaction with visual information.

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Purpose In academic work, it is important to identify a specific domain of research. Many researchers may look to conference issues to determine interesting or new topics. Furthermore, conference issues can help researchers identify current research trends in their field and learn about cutting-edge developments in their area of specialization. However, so much conference information is published online that it can be difficult to navigate and analyze in a meaningful or productive way. Hence, the use of knowledge management (KM) could be a way to resolve these issues. In KM, ontology is widely adopted, but most ontology construction methods do not consider social information between target users. Therefore, this study aims to propose a novel method of constructing research topic maps using an open directory project (ODP) and social information.Design/methodology/approach The approach is to incorporate conference information (i.e. title, keywords and abstract) as sources and to consider the ways in which social information automatically produces research topic maps. The methodology can be divided into four modules: data collection, element extraction, social information analysis and visualization. The data collection module collects the required conference data from the internet and performs pre-processing. Then, the element extraction module extracts topics, associations and other basic elements of topic maps while considering social information. Finally, the results will be shown in the visualization module for researchers to browse and search.Findings The results of this study propose three main findings. First, creating topic maps with the ODP category information can help capture a richer set of classification associations. Second, social information should be considered when constructing topic maps. This study includes the relationship among different authors and topics to support information in social networks. By considering social information, such as co-authorship/collaborator, this method helps researchers find research topics that are unfamiliar but interesting or potential cooperative opportunities in the future. Third, this study presents topic maps that show a clear and simple pathway in interested domain knowledge.Research limitations implications First, this study analyzes and collects conference information, including the titles, keywords and abstracts of conference papers, so the data set must include all of the abovementioned information. Second, social information only analyzes co-authorship associations (collabship associations); other social information could be extracted in the future study. Third, this study only analyzes the associations between topics. The intensity of associations is not discussed in the study.Originality/value The study will have a great impact on learned societies because it bridges the gap between theory and practice. The study is useful for researchers who want to know which conferences are related to their research. Moreover, social networks can help researchers expand and diversify their research.",

However, the existing achievements do not focus on China, which is the fastest growing market for children's books in the world. Studies using quantitative analysis are low in number, especially on the intellectual structure, evolution patterns, and development trends of topics of children's bestsellers in China. Dangdang.com, the biggest Chinese online bookstore, was chosen as a data source to obtain children's bestsellers, and topic words in them were extracted from brief introductions. With the aid of co-occurrence theory and tools of social network analysis and visualization, the distribution, correlation structures, and evolution patterns of topics were revealed and visualized. This study shows that topics of Chinese children's bestsellers are broad and relatively concentrated, but their distribution is unbalanced. There are four distinguished topic communities (Living, Animal, World, and Child) in terms of centrality and maturity, and they all establish their individual systems and tend to be mature. The evolution of these communities tends to be stable with powerful continuity.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to enrich query answering with a short data movie that gives insights to the original results of an OLAP query. Our method, implemented in an actual system, CineCubes , includes the following steps. The user submits a query over an underlying star schema. Taking this query as input, the system comes up with a set of queries complementing the information content of the original query, and executes them. For each of the query results, we execute a set of highlight extraction algorithms that identify interesting patterns and values in the data of the results. Then, the system visualizes the query results and accompanies this presentation with a text commenting on the result highlights. Moreover, via a text-to-speech conversion the system automatically produces audio for the constructed text. Each combination of visualization, text and audio practically constitutes a movie, which is wrapped as a PowerPoint presentation and returned to the user.",

To uncover the differences and similarities of their research topics in the aspect of dynamic distribution, and explore the future development state of relevant research, this study collected a set of scientific papers from 2014 to 2019 on the Web of Science to construct the co-keyword network sequences for the disciplines of LIS and CS respectively. The networking topology and evolutionary context of research topics in recent research of these two information-related disciplines were analyzed through a self-developed visualization tool for network evolution analysis\u2014NEViewer. This study suggests that CS pays more attention to the studies of information technologies, while LIS focuses more on the communication, organization, access, and use of information. Meanwhile, based on the perspective of discipline-comparative, the development patterns in these two disciplines were summarized. That is, the research connotation of CS is more concentrated while the research denotation of LIS is more extensive, and the research hotspots of LIS have shifted slightly faster, while the continuity of the research development in CS is slightly higher. The results reported in this study also show that there is moderate interdisciplinarity in the research and application of information technology between these two disciplines, which indicates that some increasingly mature technologies in CS will be more deeply applied in the future research of LIS.",

        "Abstract": "Massive open online courses (MOOCs) show highly irregular participation behaviour among users. In this study, using data from Computer Science 50x of HarvardX, we investigated one extreme, yet common strategy to foresee the endgame: taking the final problem set at the beginning of the course. We found such a strategy to be the only dominant trajectory alternative to following the sequence prescribed by the syllabus. Whereas all students who took and passed the final problem set at the beginning of the course subsequently completed the course, those who took and failed the final problem set at the beginning of the course finished the fewest number of milestones, even fewer than those who never attempted the final problem set. Moreover, students with a lower prior programming proficiency were more likely than better prepared students both to take the final problem set early and to fail it. This study revealed the disconcerting phenomenon that many students dropped out of a MOOC because, apparently, their confidence was crushed even before they learned any course content. The study suggests that future MOOC practices and policies should offer informative and constructive syllabi to accommodate students' need for previewing the endgame.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract Many policy-makers are struggling to understand participatory governance in the midst of technological changes. Advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) continue to have an impact on the ways that policy-makers and citizens engage with each other throughout the policy-making process. A set of developments in the areas of opening government data, advanced analytics, visualization, simulation, and gaming, and ubiquitous citizen access using mobile and personalized applications is shaping the interactions between policy-makers and citizens. Yet the impact of these developments on the policy-makers is unclear. The changing roles and need for new capabilities required from the government are analyzed in this paper using two case studies. Salient new roles for policy-makers are outlined focused on orchestrating the policy-making process. Research directions are identified including understand the behavior of users, aggregating and analyzing content from scattered resources, and the effective use of the new tools. Understanding new policy-makers roles will help to bridge the gap between the potential of tools and technologies and the organizational realities and political contexts. We argue that many examples are available that enable learning from others, in both directions, developed countries experiences are useful for developing countries and experiences from the latter are valuable for the former countries. Highlights \u2022 Utilization of new technologies continues to influence the role of non-experts in policy-making \u2022 The traditional view of a policy-maker as a lone expert is further losing ground to models enabling many expert voices \u2022 New roles for policy-makers include engaging, quality assurance and aggregation/reporting \u2022 A substantial gap remains between design and implementation of tools, this continues to impact their usefulness \u2022 Many practices are available which enable learning from others",

These systems enable users to explore collections by way of latent topics. A standard way to represent a topic is using a term list; that is the top- n words with highest conditional probability within the topic. Other topic representations such as textual and image labels also have been proposed. However, there has been no comparison of these alternative representations. In this article, we compare 3 different topic representations in a document retrieval task. Participants were asked to retrieve relevant documents based on predefined queries within a fixed time limit, presenting topics in one of the following modalities: (a) lists of terms, (b) textual phrase labels, and (c) image labels. Results show that textual labels are easier for users to interpret than are term lists and image labels. Moreover, the precision of retrieved documents for textual and image labels is comparable to the precision achieved by representing topics using term lists, demonstrating that labeling methods are an effective alternative topic representation.",

        "Abstract": "Information security has become a central societal concern over the past two decades. Few studies have examined the information security research domain, and no literature has been found that has applied an objective, quantitative methodology. The central aim of the current research was to quantitatively describe the profile and evolution of the information security specialty. Bibliometric data extracted from 74,021 Scopus research records published from 1965 to 2015 were examined using impact and productivity measures as well as co-word and domain visualization techniques. This scientometric study presents a comprehensive view of the information security specialty from several perspectives (e.g., temporal, seminal papers, institutions, sources, authors). After a long and steady period of growth (1965-2004), an exponential publication output occurred between 2005 and 2010. Among all the countries involved in information security research, the United States and China had the greatest impact, and China has surpassed the United States in terms of productivity. Information security as a specialty is largely populated by publications from the technical fields of computer science and engineering. Several research themes were found throughout the decades (e.g., cryptography and information security management and administration), and emergent research subspecialties appeared in later decades (e.g., intrusion detection, medical data security, steganography, wireless security). This study reduces the complexity of the specialty to controllable terms, supplies objective data for science policy making, identifies the salient bibliographic units, and uncovers growth patterns. It also serves as an information retrieval tool to identify important papers, authors, and institutions.",

        "Abstract": "This study explores how user subject knowledge influences search task processes and outcomes, as well as how search behavior is influenced by subject\u2010oriented information visualization (IV) tools. To enable integrated searches, the proposed WikiMap+ integrates search functions and IV tools (i.e., a topic network and hierarchical topic tree) and gathers information from Wikipedia pages and Google Search results. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed interfaces, we design subject\u2010oriented tasks and adopt extended evaluation measures. We recruited 48 novices and 48 knowledgeable users, that is, intermediates, for the evaluation. Our results show that novices using the proposed interface demonstrate better search performance than intermediates using Wikipedia. We therefore conclude that our tools help close the gap between novices and intermediates in information searches. The results also show that intermediates can take advantage of the search tool by leveraging the IV tools to browse subtopics, and formulate better queries with less effort. We conclude that embedding the IV and the search tools in the interface can result in different search behavior but improved task performance. We provide implications to design search systems to include IV features adapted to user levels of subject knowledge to help them achieve better task performance.",

        "Abstract": "To solve today\u2019s ecological problems, scientists need well documented, validated, and coherent data archives. Historically, however, ecologists have collected and stored data idiosyncratically, making data integration even among close collaborators difficult. Further, effective ecology data warehouses and subsequent data mining require that individual databases be accurately described with metadata against which the data themselves have been validated. Using database technology would make documenting data sets for archiving, integration, and data mining easier, but few ecologists have expertise to use database technology and they cannot afford to hire programmers. In this paper, we identify the benefits that would accrue from ecologists\u2019 use of modern information technology and the obstacles that prevent that use. We describe our prototype, the Canopy DataBank, through which we aim to enable individual ecologists in the forest canopy research community to be their own database programmers. The key feature that makes this possible is domain-specific database components, which we call templates. We also show how additional tools that reuse these components, such as for visualization, could provide gains in productivity and motivate the use of new technology. Finally, we suggest ways in which communities might share database components and how components might be used to foster easier data integration to solve new ecological problems.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Semantic labelling refers to the problem of assigning known labels to the elements of structured information from a source such as an HTML table or an RDF dump with unknown semantics. In the recent years it has become progressively more relevant due to the growth of available structured information in the Web of data that need to be labelled in order to integrate it in data systems. The existing approaches for semantic labelling have several drawbacks that make them unappealing if not impossible to use in certain scenarios: not accepting nested structures as input, being unable to label structural elements, not being customisable, requiring groups of instances when labelling, requiring matching instances to named entities in a knowledge base, not detecting numeric data, or not supporting complex features. In this article, we propose TAPON-MT, a framework for machine learning semantic labelling. Our framework does not have the former limitations, which makes it domain-independent and customisable. We have implemented it with a graphical interface that eases the creation and analysis of models, and we offer a web service API for their application. We have also validated it with a subset of the National Science Foundation awards dataset, and our conclusion is that TAPON-MT creates models to label information that are effective and efficient in practice. \u2022 We present TAPON-MT, a versatile, customisable semantic-labelling framework. \u2022 TAPON-MT labels both textual and structural elements in arbitrary datasets. \u2022 TAPON-MT's modular architecture enables adding complex features to the model. \u2022 TAPON-MT allows the visualisation and validation of models for diagnosis of errors. \u2022 Our validation with the NSF awards dataset, shows an improvement in accuracy.",

After the query log contents were cleaned and query data were parsed, popular sports-related keywords were identified, along with frequently co-occurring query terms associated with the identified keywords. Relationships among each sports-related focus keyword and its related keywords were characterized and grouped using multidimensional scaling (MDS) in combination with traditional hierarchical clustering methods. The two approaches were synthesized in a visual context by highlighting the results of the hierarchical clustering analysis in the visual MDS configuration. Important events, people, subjects, merchandise, and so on related to a sport were illustrated, and relationships among the sports were analyzed. A small-scale comparative study of sports searches with and without term assistance was conducted. Searches that used search term assistance by relying on previous query term relationships outperformed the searches without the search term assistance. The findings of this study provide insights into sports information seeking behavior on the Internet. The developed method also may be applied to other query log subject areas.",

The three networks were then combined into a new one by summing up their values, which were later normalized through geo-normalization measure. Finally, the VOS clustering algorithm was executed and the journal clusters obtained were labeled using original SJR category tags and significant words from journal titles.Findings The resultant scientogram displays the SJR structure through a set of communities equivalent to SJR categories that represent the subject contents of the journals they cover. A higher level of aggregation by areas provides a broad view of the SJR structure, facilitating its analysis and visualization at the same time.Originality/value This is the first study using Persson\u2019s combination of most popular citation-based links (direct citation, co-citation and bibliographic coupling) in order to develop a scientogram based on Scopus journals from SJR. The integration of the three measures along with performance of the VOS community detection algorithm gave a balanced set of clusters. The resulting scientogram is useful for assessing and validating previous classifications as well as for information retrieval and domain analysis.",

In this paper, we discuss how knowledge maps can be generated using Memory Island. Memory Island is our cartographic visualization technique, which was inspired by the ancient 'Art of Memory'. It consists of automatically creating the spatial cartographic representation of a given hierarchical knowledge (e.g., ontology). With the help of its interactive functions, users can navigate through an artificial landscape, to learn and retrieve information from the knowledge. We also present some preliminary results of representing different hierarchical knowledge to show how the knowledge maps created by our technique work.",

Ten RDs participated in a within-subjects experiment to compare Glucolyzer to a static logbook format.

Participants identified more observations that included ingredients other than carbohydrates using Glucolyzer (36% vs 16%, p\u2009=\u2009.027). Fewer RDs reported feelings of information overload using Glucolyzer compared to the logbook format. Study participants displayed variable acceptance of hierarchical clustering.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Visual analytics have the potential to mitigate provider concerns about the volume of self-monitoring data. Glucolyzer helped dietitians identify meaningful patterns in self-monitoring data without incurring perceived information overload. Future studies should assess whether similar tools can support clinicians in personalizing behavioral interventions that improve patient outcomes.",

This article explores the potential of interdisciplinary perspectives by investigating the thematic overlap between economic and sociological approaches to wealth inequality.

On the basis of complete bibliographies of these selected articles, we construct co-citation networks and obtain thematic clusters. What becomes evident is a low thematic overlap: Economists explore the causes of wealth inequality based on mathematical models and study the interplay between inequality and economic growth. Sociologists focus mostly on wealth disparities between ethnic groups. The article identifies, however, a few instances of cross-disciplinary borrowing and the French economist Thomas Piketty as a novel advocate of interdisciplinarity in the field. The prospects of an economics-cum-sociology of wealth inequality are discussed in the conclusion.",

Given its inherent interdisciplinarity, we ask what might a map of the physical, cultural, and intellectual geography of the KO community look like? Who is participating in this discipline's scholarly discussion, and from what locations, both geographically and intellectually? Using the unit of authorship in the journal Knowledge Organization, where is the nexus of KO activity and what patterns of authorship can be identified? Cultural characteristics were applied as a lens to explore who is and is not participating in the international conversation about KO. World Bank GNI per capita estimates were used to compare relative wealth of countries and Hofstede's Individualism dimension was identified as a way of understanding attributes of countries whose scholars are participating in this dialog. Descriptive statistics were generated through Excel, and data visualizations were rendered through Tableau Public and TagCrowd.

However, few studies have clarified the features among varied visualization approaches involved in graphic-based tag clouds and compared them for the purpose of information search. Design/methodology/approach: After reviewing four kinds of graphic-based tag clouds, an experimental demonstration was conducted in our study to verify how user performs in information search for a general seeking task by using them. Precision ratio, recall ratio, clicks on search and time for search were four variables tested in the experiment. Also, two supplementary tests were respectively carried out to manifest how graphic-based tag clouds contributed to the identification of target tags and tag clusters. Findings: The experimental results showed that compared to tag content visual tag structure was more important to find related tags from tag clouds for information search. In addition, tag clouds that visually represented the semantic relationships within tags could make user more confident about their search result and carry out a shorter learning process during searching, which signified a tag-based information search path when visual elements were applied. Originality/value: This research is one of the first to illustrate systematically the graphic-based tag clouds and their impacts on information search. The research findings could suggest on how to build up more effective and interactive tag clouds and make proposition for the design of search user interface by using graphic-based tag clouds.",

Literature research is an important method to acquire scientific and technical information which is important for research, development and innovation of science and technology. It is difficult but urgently required to acquire accurate, timely, rapid, short and comprehensive information from the large-scale and fast-growing literature, especially in the big data era. Existing literature-based information retrieval systems focus on basic data organization, and they are far from meeting the needs of information analytics. It becomes urgent to organize and analyze scientific research events related to scientific and technical literature for forecasting development trend of science and technology.Design/methodology/approach Scientific literature such as a paper or a patent is represented as a scientific research event, which contains elements including when, where, who, what, how and why. Metadata of literature is used to formulate scientific research events that are implied in introduction and related work sections of literature. Named entities and research objects such as methods, materials and algorithms can be extracted from texts of literature by using text analysis. The authors semantically link scientific research events, entities and objects, and then, they construct the event space for supporting scientific and technical information analysis.Findings This paper represents scientific literature as events, which are coarse-grained units comparing with entities and relations in current information organizations. Events and semantic relations among them together formulate a semantic link network, which could support event-centric information browsing, search and recommendation.Research limitations/implications The proposed model is a theoretical model, and it needs to verify the efficiency in further experimental application research. The evaluation and applications of semantic link network of scientific research events are further research issues.Originality/value This paper regards scientific literature as scientific research events and proposes an approach to semantically link events into a network with multiple-typed entities and relations. According to the needs of scientific and technical information analysis, scientific research events are organized into event cubes which are distributed in a three-dimensioned space for easy-to-understand and information visualization.",

        "Abstract": "As a primary digital library portal for astrophysics researchers, SAO/NASA ADS (Astrophysics Data System) 2.0 interface features several visualization tools such as Author Network and Metrics. This research study involves 20 ADS long term users who participated in a usability and eye tracking research session. Participants first completed a cognitive test, and then performed five tasks in ADS 2.0 where they explored its multiple visualization tools. Results show that over half of the participants were Imagers and half of the participants were Analytic. Cognitive styles were found to have significant impacts on several efficiency-based measures. Analytic-oriented participants were observed to spent shorter time on web pages and apps, made fewer web page changes than less-Analytic-driving participants in performing common tasks, whereas AI (Analytic-Imagery) participants also completed their five tasks faster than non-AI participants. Meanwhile, self-identified Imagery participants were found to be more efficient in their task completion through multiple measures including total time on task, number of mouse clicks, and number of query revisions made. Imagery scores were negatively associated with frequency of confusion and the observed counts of being surprised. Compared to those who did not claimed to be a visual person, self-identified Imagery participants were observed to have significantly less frequency in frustration and hesitation during their task performance. Both demographic variables and past user experiences were found to correlate with task performance; query revision also correlated with multiple time-based measurements. Considered as an indicator of efficiency, query revisions were found to correlate negatively with the rate of complete with ease, and positively with several time-based efficiency measures, rate of complete with some difficulty, and the frequency of frustration. These results provide rich insights into the cognitive styles of ADS' core users, the impact of such styles and demographic attributes on their task performance their affective and cognitive experiences, and their interaction behaviors while using the visualization component of ADS 2.0, and would subsequently contribute to the design of bibliographic retrieval systems for scientists.",

        "Abstract": "Keyphrases aid the exploration of text collections by communicating salient aspects of documents and are often used to create effective visualizations of text. While prior work in HCI and visualization has proposed a variety of ways of presenting keyphrases, less attention has been paid to selecting the best descriptive terms. In this article, we investigate the statistical and linguistic properties of keyphrases chosen by human judges and determine which features are most predictive of high-quality descriptive phrases. Based on 5,611 responses from 69 graduate students describing a corpus of dissertation abstracts, we analyze characteristics of human-generated keyphrases, including phrase length, commonness, position, and part of speech. Next, we systematically assess the contribution of each feature within statistical models of keyphrase quality. We then introduce a method for grouping similar terms and varying the specificity of displayed phrases so that applications can select phrases dynamically based on the available screen space and current context of interaction. Precision-recall measures find that our technique generates keyphrases that match those selected by human judges. Crowdsourced ratings of tag cloud visualizations rank our approach above other automatic techniques. Finally, we discuss the role of HCI methods in developing new algorithmic techniques suitable for user-facing applications.",

The Web, we find, has had a profound impact on IS, driving the creation of new disciplines and revitalization or obsolescence of old, and most importantly, bridging the chasm between the \u201cliteratures\u201d and \u201cretrieval\u201d IS camps. Simultaneously, the development of IS towards cognitive aspects has intensified. Our study enriches classic ACA in that it employs both orthogonal and oblique rotations in the factor analysis (FA), and reports both pattern and structure matrices for the latter, thus enabling a comparison between these several FA methods in ACA. Each method provides interesting information not available from the others, we find, especially when results are also visualized in the novel manner we introduce here.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Purpose Nowadays, the event detection is so important in gathering news from social media. Indeed, it is widely employed by journalists to generate early alerts of reported stories. In order to incorporate available data on social media into a news story, journalists must manually process, compile and verify the news content within a very short time span. Despite its utility and importance, this process is time-consuming and labor-intensive for media organizations. Because of the afore-mentioned reason and as social media provides an essential source of data used as a support for professional journalists, the purpose of this paper is to propose the citizen clustering technique which allows the community of journalists and media professionals to document news during crises.Design/methodology/approach The authors develop, in this study, an approach for natural hazard events news detection and danger citizen' groups clustering based on three major steps. In the first stage, the authors present a pipeline of several natural language processing tasks: event trigger detection, applied to recuperate potential event triggers; named entity recognition, used for the detection and recognition of event participants related to the extracted event triggers; and, ultimately, a dependency analysis between all the extracted data. Analyzing the ambiguity and the vagueness of similarity of news plays a key role in event detection. This issue was ignored in traditional event detection techniques. To this end, in the second step of our approach, the authors apply fuzzy sets techniques on these extracted events to enhance the clustering quality and remove the vagueness of the extracted information. Then, the defined degree of citizens' danger is injected as input to the introduced citizens clustering method in order to detect citizens' communities with close disaster degrees.Findings Empirical results indicate that homogeneous and compact citizen' clusters can be detected using the suggested event detection method. It can also be observed that event news can be analyzed efficiently using the fuzzy theory. In addition, the proposed visualization process plays a crucial role in data journalism, as it is used to analyze event news, as well as in the final presentation of detected danger citizens' clusters.Originality/value The introduced citizens clustering method is profitable for journalists and editors to better judge the veracity of social media content, navigate the overwhelming, identify eyewitnesses and contextualize the event. The empirical analysis results illustrate the efficiency of the developed method for both real and artificial networks.",

Shared physical workplaces provide natural support for tasks such as (a) social reminding about communication commitments and keeping track of collaborators and friends, and (b) social data mining of local expertise for advice and information. However, many people now collaborate remotely using tools such as email and voicemail. Our field studies show that these tools do not provide the social cues needed for group work processes. In part, this is be- cause the tools are organized around messages, rather than people. In response to this problem, we created ContactMap, a system that makes people the primary unit of interaction. ContactMap provides a structured social desktop representation of users' important contacts that directly supports social reminding and social data mining. We conducted an empirical evaluation of ContactMap, comparing it with traditional email systems, on tasks suggested by our fieldwork. Users performed better with ContactMap and preferred ContactMap for the majority of these tasks. We discuss future enhancements of our system and the implications of these results for future communication interfaces and for theories of mediated communication.",

This is a case study where tag cloud is being used as a tool for information visualisation and information retrieval to create awareness about new arrivals in the library. For the purpose of creating awareness amongst the user of the library and promote the use of newly catalogued resources, an online social cataloguing system 'Shelfari' (http://shelfari.com) has been used. The new arrivals are catalogued through social cataloguing system. The Library of Congress subject heading (LCSH) and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are being used as tag words for each resource. The tag cloud created in this way has been evaluated for the effectiveness of the social cataloguing. The results suggest that tag clouding helps to create a visual effect and help users to learn about availability of the resources in the library along with the collaborative activities such as reviews and feedbacks, to choose right kind of reading materials. Social cataloguing activities are now getting momentum in online social network system. The use of internet and social network activities are increasing day-by-day so as the use of reviews and feedback for choosing right reading material. This study shall be valuable for those who are interested in choosing right reading materials based on popularity.",

We introduce a unified visualization environment that is able to present various types of patterns and thus to facilitate explorations of the incident data from different perspectives. With the visualization environment one can visualize either spatiomultivariate, spatiotemporal, temporal - multivariate, or spatiotemporal - multivariate patterns. For example, the analyst can examine the characteristics (in terms of target types, tactics, or other multivariate vectors) of aggregated incidents and at the same time perceive how multivariate characteristics change over time and vary spatially. Special attention is devoted to the application-specific data analysis process, from data compilation, geocoding, preprocessing, and transformation, through customization and configuration of visualization components, to the interpretation and presentation of discovered patterns.",

Digital libraries contain a colossal amount of information, that is why, it is critical to design more user-friendly interfaces to explore, understand, and manage their content. According to the author, one important technique for designing interfaces is to use information visualization. Although it is a relatively new research area, numerous visualization application already exist in various fields today. Many library professionals are also starting to realize that combining information visualization techniques and current library technologies, can help library users find information more effectively and efficiently.",

Spatial analysis of the data set reveals an understanding of the problem of poverty in the served region that may not be observed by using conventional statistical analyses. The visualization of service data makes information more comprehensible to practitioners and community stakeholders, and helps create an empowering environment in the service review and planning processes.

Design/methodology/approach: Two mapping methods are used, namely, co-citation analysis and co-occurrence analysis. Both the co-citation analysis and co-occurrence analysis in this study are conducted using CiteSpace, a Java-based scientific visualization software. Findings: This paper detects changes in academic communities in 24 business journals chosen by the University of Texas at Dallas as leading journals (UTD24) and identifies the research hotspots such as corporate governance, organizational research and capital research. Many authors and academic communities appear in two or even three periods, which indicates the lasting academic vitality of scholars in this field. This paper determines the evolution of scholars' research interests by identifying high-frequency keywords during the entire period. Originality/value: This paper reveals a systematic and holistic picture of the developmental landscape of the business domain, which can provide a potential guide for future research. Furthermore, based on empirical data and knowledge visualization, the intellectual structure and evolution of the business domain can be identified more objectively.",

        "Abstract": "When bibliometric data are converted to term frequency (tf) and inverse document frequency (idf) values, plotted as pennant diagrams, and interpreted according to Sperber and Wilson's relevance theory (RT), the results evoke major variables of information science (IS). These include topicality, in the sense of intercohesion and intercoherence among texts; cognitive effects of texts in response to people's questions; people's levels of expertise as a precondition for cognitive effects;processing effort as textual or other messages are received; specificity of terms as it affects processing effort; relevance, defined in RT as the effects/effort ratio; and authority of texts and their authors. While such concerns figure automatically in dialogues between people, they become problematic when people create or use or judge literature-based information systems. The difficulty of achieving worthwhile cognitive effects and acceptable processing effort in human-system dialogues explains why relevance is the central concern of IS. Moreover, since relevant communication with both systems and unfamiliar people is uncertain, speakers tend to seek cognitive effects that cost them the least effort. Yet hearers need greater effort, often greater specificity, from speakers if their responses are to be highly relevant in their turn. This theme of mismatch manifests itself in vague reference questions, underdeveloped online searches, uncreative judging in retrieval evaluation trials, and perfunctory indexing. Another effect of least effort is a bias toward topical relevance over other kinds. RT can explain these outcomes as well as more adaptive ones. Pennant diagrams, applied here to a literature search and a Bradford-style journal analysis, can model them. Given RT and the right context, bibliometrics may predict psychometrics.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: Companies, government agencies, and other organizations are making their data available to the world over the Internet. They often use large online relational tables for this purpose. Users query such tables with front-ends that typically use menus or form fillin interfaces, but these interfaces rarely give users information about the contents and distribution of the data. Such a situation leads users to waste time and network/server resources posing queries that have zero- or mega-hit results. Generalized query previews enable efficient browsing of large online data tables by supplying data distribution information to users. The data distribution information provides continuous feedback about the size of the result set as the query is being formed. Our paper presents a new user interface architecture and discusses three controlled experiments (with 12, 16, and 48 participants). Our prototype systems provide flexible user interfaces for research and testing of the ideas. The user studies show that for exploratory querying tasks, generalized query previews can speed user performance for certain user domains and can reduce network/server load.",

In the web era the genre of the printed paper has survived in digital format as static PDF, but annotations, multimedia and access to data are appearing as new interactive features of innovative scholarly journals. Together they justify the term Rich Internet Publication (RIP) as name for a new emerging genre. Because of the authoritative role of publications in highly ranked journals, a RIP is mostly used as a 'showcase' to publish supplementary material that could not be made available otherwise, and to generate a broader interest in a project. The traditional authoring of linear text does not adequately fit the new situation, in which the author has to deal with much more information in various formats and has access to new options for presentation. This paper describes a strategy to transform a regular paper into a RIP. The strategy is divided into a conceptual stage, in which focal points are created and a balanced mixture of different media are achieved divided over different levels, and the implementation.",

The purpose of this paper is to employ the DID3 projects as a case study to explore the following research question: what roles do librarians and archivists take on in data-intensive, interdisciplinary, and international DH projects?Design/methodology/approach Participation was secured from 53 persons representing eleven projects. The study was conducted in the naturalistic paradigm. It is a qualitative case study involving snowball sampling, semi-structured interviews, and grounded analysis.Findings Librarians or archivists were involved officially in 3 of the 11 projects (27.3 percent). Perhaps more importantly, information professionals played vital unofficial roles in these projects, namely as consultants and liaisons and also as technical support. Information and library science (ILS) expertise helped DID3 researchers with issues such as visualization, rights management, and user testing. DID3 participants also suggested ways in which librarians and archivists might further support DH projects, concentrating on three key areas: curation, outreach, and ILS education. Finally, six directions for future research are suggested.Originality/value Much untapped potential exists for librarians and archivists to collaborate with DH scholars; a gap exists between researcher awareness and information professionals\u2019 capacity.",

For this purpose, the relevant bibliographic references from five databases (ERIC, LISA, LISTA, Scopus and WOS) were retrieved. To systematize the keywords, high dimensionality is reduced by means of a term-based process. Fields, topics, sub-topics and top terms are defined. The main top-terms and their relationships are analysed applying the fractional counting methodology using VOSViewer software. Fifteen major themes were set, which were grouped into six clusters to identify the main thematic trends during the period under review: IL and e-learning, Mobile devices and competencies, Ethics, Library and e-resources, Educational technology and Technological environment. The convergence of IL and e-learning, the growth of e-literacy, the increasing relationship between mobile devices and information competencies, as well as that of libraries and e-resources, are thus detected. In conclusion, there is evidence of a growing interdisciplinarity in the scientific publications on Mobile Information Literacy, which interrelates the studies of information and digital literacy with e-learning and mobile technologies.",

In this paper, we address a specific challenge in the practice of enterprise knowledge management while extracting actionable nuggets from diverse data sources of seemingly related information. In particular, we address the challenge of archiving knowledge gained through collaboration, dissemination and visualization as part of the data analysis inference and decision-making lifecycle. We motivate the implementation of an enterprise data discovery and knowledge recorder tool called SEEKER based on a real-world case study. We motivate the implementation of an enterprise data discovery and knowledge recorder tool called SEEKER (Schema Exploration and Evolving Knowledge Entity Recorder) based on the queries and the analytical artifacts that are being created by analysts as they use the data. We show how the tool serves as a digital record of institutional domain knowledge and as documentation for the evolution of data elements, queries and schemas over time. As a knowledge management service, a tool like SEEKER saves enterprise resources and time by (1) avoiding analytic \"silos\" (i.e., a separate set of data that is not included in an enterprise's data administration), (2) expediting the process of multi-source data integration and (3) intelligently documenting discoveries from collaborating analysts.",

        "Abstract": "A modified approach to algorithmic historiography is used to investigate the changing influence of the work of Conrad Hal Waddington over the period 1945\u20132004. Overall, Waddington's publications were cited by almost 5,500 source items in the Web of Science (Thomson Scientific, formerly Thomson ISI, Philadelphia, PA). Rather than simply analyzing the data set as a whole, older works by Waddington are incorporated into a series of historiographic maps (networks of highly cited documents), which show long-term and short-term research themes grounded in Waddington's work. Analysis by 10\u201320-year periods and the use of social network analysis soft- ware reveals structures\u2014thematic networks and subnetworks\u2014that are hidden in a mapping of the entire 60-year period. Two major Waddington-related themes emerge\u2014canalization/genetic assimilation and embryonic induction. The first persists over the 60 years studied while active, visible research in the second appears to have declined markedly between 1965 and 1984, only to reappear in conjunction with the emergence of a new research field\u2014Evolutionary Developmental Biology.",

        "Abstract": "Scientific disciplines are distinct not only in what they know but in how they know what they know-that is, in their 'epistemic cultures.' There is a close relationship between the technologies that a field utilizes and sanctions and the process of inquiry, the character and meaning of corroborative data and evidence, and the kinds of models and theories developed in a field. As the machinery changes, epistemic practices also change. A case in point is how the epistemic practices of historians are reconfigured by the introduction of Geographic Information Systems ( GIS). We argue that GIS mediates historical understanding and knowledge creation in at least three ways: (a) by allowing historians to bring new sets of data into analysis, (b) by introducing novel questions, fresh insights, and new modes of analysis and reasoning, or discovering new answers to older questions; and (c) by providing new tools for historians to communicate with each other and with their audiences. We illustrate these mediations through the study of the historiography of Budapest Ghettos during World War II. Our study shows how GIS functionalities reveal hitherto unknown aspects of social life in the ghettos, while pushing certain other aspects into the background.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose \u2013 The authors introduce two semantics-based navigation applications that facilitate information-seeking activities in internal link-based web sites in Wikipedia. These applications aim to help users find concepts within a topic and related articles on a given topic quickly and then gain topical knowledge from internal link-based encyclopedia web sites. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The WNavis application consists of three information visualization (IV) tools which are a topic network, a hierarchy topic tree and summaries for topics. The WikiMap application consists of a topic network. The goal of the topic network and topic tree tools is to help users to find the major concepts of a topic and identify relationships between these major concepts easily. In addition, in order to locate specific information and enable users to explore and read topic-related articles quickly, the topic tree and summaries for topics tools support users to gain topical knowledge quickly. The authors then apply the k-clique of cohesive indicator to analyze the sub topics of the seed query and find out the best clustering results via the cosine measure. The authors utilize four metrics, which are correctness, time cost, usage behaviors, and satisfaction, to evaluate the three interfaces. These metrics measure both the outputs and outcomes of applications. As a baseline system for evaluation the authors used a traditional Wikipedia interface. For the evaluation, the authors used an experimental user study with 30 participants. Findings \u2013 The results indicate that both WikiMap and WNavis supported users to identify concepts and their relations better compared to the baseline. In topical tasks WNavis over performed both WikiMap and the baseline system. Although there were no time differences in finding concepts or answering topical questions, the test systems provided users with a greater gain per time unit. The users of WNavis leaned on the hierarchy tree instead of other tools, whereas WikiMap users used the topic map. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The findings have implications for the design of IR support tools in knowledge-intensive web sites that help users to explore topics and concepts. Originality/value \u2013 The authors explored to what extent the use of each IV support tool contributed to successful exploration of topics in search tasks. The authors propose extended task-based evaluation measures to understand how each application provides useful context for users to accomplish the tasks and attain the search goals. That is, the authors not only evaluate the output of the search results, e.g. the number of relevant items retrieved, but also the outcome provided by the system for assisting users to attain the search goal.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a class predictive model for categorical data; this model uses the contrast patterns (CPs) that characteristically appear in a specific class. In a previous study, Morita and Nishiguchi [(2013). Classification model using contrast patterns. In the 15th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, Vol. 1, pp. 336-341] proposed a classification model using contrast patterns (CACP). CACP has been applied to practical data and successfully used to construct effective models [Morita, H, Y Shirai and Y Nakamoto (2013). Analysis method for flash marketing incorporating diversification on purchasing. In Annual Conference of Japan Society for Management Information 2013 Autumn, pp. 329-332 (in Japanese); Nishiguchi, M (2014). Classification model using contrast patterns and GRASP. Journal of Information Assurance & Security, 9(5), 235-243]. In their research, we can see that a large number of CPs are required to construct a high-performance model that can be applied to real business data. In terms of knowledge management, the model must provide highly accurate predictions, and offer high readability for their implementations. Such models provide a significant amount of knowledge. To find such knowledge, it is important to select a necessary subset of CPs and to construct a simple model, while maintaining the performance of the model. Further, we propose a visualisation method called Contrast Ranked Path Diagram (CRPD) that allows us to interpret the relationships among the CPs. In computational experiments, we initially apply our method to well-known benchmark problems. From the results, we show that our proposed model outperforms existing methods in terms of the necessary number of CPs and prediction accuracy. Subsequently, we apply our method to actual data from a Japanese retailer, and show the usefulness of the data for business applications.",

We exemplify our strategies to the classical problem of author name disambiguation where we show how uncertainty can be modeled explained and visualized using information fusion. We show how an information seeker can benefit from tracing increases/decreases of uncertainty in the reasoning process. We also present how such changes can be explained for the information seeker through visualization techniques, which are employed to highlight the complexity involved in the process of modeling and managing uncertainty in bibliometric analysis. Finally we argue that a further integration of information fusion approaches in the research area of bibliometrics and information retrieval may results in new and fruitful venues of research.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>In December 2019, a few coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Soon after, increasing numbers of cases were detected in other parts of China, eventually leading to a disease outbreak in China. As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus, such as its pathogenesis, spread, prevention, and containment.<bold>Objective: </bold>The aim of this study was to collect media reports on COVID-19 and investigate the patterns of media-directed health communications as well as the role of the media in this ongoing COVID-19 crisis in China.<bold>Methods: </bold>We adopted the WiseSearch database to extract related news articles about the coronavirus from major press media between January 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. We then sorted and analyzed the data using Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number with evidence of the coherence number. We operated latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling with a suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We then divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling.<bold>Results: </bold>After removing duplications and irrelevant reports, our search identified 7791 relevant news reports. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as the number of topics and generated the topics' themes and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine main primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three most popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, and global or local social and economic influences, accounting for 32.57% (n=2538), 16.08% (n=1258), and 11.79% (n=919) of the collected reports, respectively.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Topic modeling of news articles can produce useful information about the significance of mass media for early health communication. Comparing the number of articles for each day and the outbreak development, we noted that mass media news reports in China lagged behind the development of COVID-19. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society rather than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a worldwide issue, and society has become concerned about donations and support as well as mental health among others. We recommend that future work addresses the mass media's actual impact on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.",

Generally, potential customers usually wade through a lot of on-line reviews in order to make an informed decision. However, retrieving sentiment information relevant to customer\u2019s interest still remains challenging. Developing a sentiment mining and retrieval system is a good way to overcome the problem of overloaded information in customer reviews. In this paper, we propose a sentiment mining and retrieval system which mines useful knowledge from consumer product reviews by utilizing data mining and information retrieval technology. A novel ranking mechanism taking temporal opinion quality (TOQ) and relevance into account is developed to meet customers\u2019 information need. Besides the trend movement of customer reviews and the comparison between positive and negative evaluation are presented visually in the system. Experimental results on a real-world data set show the system is feasible and effective.",

However, since the paper should be able to stand alone, it includes many still valid elements of the previous article. Following the original paper, we propose criteria for the tool categorization based on different user groups, data structures, data mining tasks and methods, visualization and interaction styles, import and export options for data and models, platforms, and license policies. These criteria are then used to classify data mining tools into nine different categories. The typical characteristics of these types are explained and a selection of the most important tools is categorized.

        "Abstract": "Social networks and collaboration make it possible to offer new metacognitive horizons for comprehension of theories in a group of students considered digitally native. This study discusses the applicability of different forms of visualisation used as a constructivist learning technique on social networks. It presents the results of an innovative teaching project awarded on a competitive basis implemented in the course entitled 'Information and Communication Theory', offered for the first time in the 2017/2018 academic year within the framework of the new undergraduate degree in Management of Information and Digital Content at UC3M iSchool (Spain).This project was based on the educational use of the Twitter social network to encourage collaborative reading in a course with a significant theoretical burden and which had the handicap of being presented in the first year of the programme. Accordingly, it was based on the assumption that the familiarity of the target group of the project (first-year students) with the Twitter platform might foster greater interaction in learning theoretical contents and facilitate discussion of same and participation. Participation in the social network through observation and the metrics obtained from the platform itself revealed participation through visual elements to be a key factor in the creation of engagement on the part of the students, mainly through GIFs and memes. Evidence shows the validity of this social network as a teaching tool for fostering collaborative reading on a network, as well as the development of high-level cognitive skills such as reflection and critical thinking. Similarly, it looks at the possibilities of visual learning for fostering participation, creativity and innovation within the course.",

This research compares coauthorship networks of Iranian articles in library and information science (LIS), psychology (PSY), management (MNG), and economics (ECO) in the ISI Web of Knowledge database during 2000\u20132009, and uses network analysis for the visualization of coauthorship networks. Data include all articles with at least one Iranian author and indexed in ISI's Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) for the fields of LIS, PSY, MNG, and ECO. Indicators such as the Collaborative Index (CI), Degree of Collaboration (DC) and Collaboration Coefficient (CC) were calculated for each discipline. Results show that two or three authors were the most common number of authors per paper, and authors of PSY tended to have more multi-authored articles, compared to the other disciplines. LIS had the lowest rank regarding CC. MNG had the densest coauthorship network, and PSY had the sparsest. Iranian authors in the field of PSY mostly collaborated with those in the U.S., while LIS and MNG authors tended to collaborate with U.K. authors, and ECO authors tended to collaborate with Canadians.",

        "Abstract": "Online analytical processing (OLAP) provides tools to explore data cubes in order to extract the interesting information, it refers to techniques used to query, visualise and synthesise the multidimensional data. Nevertheless OLAP is limited on visualisation, structuring and exploring manually the data cubes. On the other side, data mining allows algorithms that offer automatic knowledge extraction, such as classification, explanation and prediction algorithms. However, OLAP is not capable of explaining and predicting events from existing data; therefore, it is possible to make a more efficient online analysis by coupling data mining and OLAP to allow the user to assist in this new task of knowledge extraction. In this paper, we will carry on within works achieved in this theme and we suggest to extend the abilities of OLAP to prediction (enhancing the OLAP abilities and techniques by introducing a predictive model based on a data mining algorithms). The model is calculated on the aggregated data, and prediction is done on detailed missing data. Our approach is based on regression trees and neural networks; it consists to predict facts having a missed measures value in the data cubes. The user will have in his disposition, a new platform called PredCube, that offers the possibility to query, visualise and synthesise the multidimensional data, and also to predict missing values in the data cube using three data mining methods, and evaluate the quality of the prediction by comparing the average error and the execution time given by each one.",

A central solution strategy for such problems, increasing transparency by argumentation visualisation, is being evaluated. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Qualitative formal content analysis is used in order to examine whether the process of definition standardisation in the project can be characterised as a wicked problem. Action Research is used to assess the effect of argumentation visualisation in the project. Findings \u2013 The results of the content analysis confirm the interpretation of the standardisation process as a wicked problem. The implementation of argumentation visualisation shows to increase the meetings\u2019 focus and effectiveness. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The relationship between information exchange, transparency and acceptance of the development result should be addressed in future empirical analyses. Visualisation solutions require further development in order to accommodate needs of the stakeholders. Practical implications \u2013 Argumentation visualisation is of high value for finding a consensus for definitional standards and should be considered for managing and exchanging information. Originality/value \u2013 Applying solution strategies from design research on wicked problems to large-scale standardisation efforts opens up new possibilities for not only handling such projects but also providing new avenues of research for both the design and research information communities.",

The result indicates that the subfields of Library and Information Science in China kept changing from 1998 to 2007: some subfields have emerged and developed a lot, e.g., webometrics and competitive intelligence; some subfields maintain, e.g., bibliometrics and intellectual property; and some subfields have begun to decline, e.g., cataloging. Through the comparison with the international LIS, it is found that there are some unique subfields in Chinese LIS from 1998 to 2007, such as competitive intelligence and intellectual property. At the same time, I also suggest that Chinese authors in LIS should pay more attention to the applied research in the future.",

Many libraries have built digital humanities scholarly commons, but it is rare in China's libraries. Through literature and website research, digital humanities database construction practice, questionnaires, and interviews with humanities scholars, we explore the path to build digital humanities scholarly commons at Beijing Normal University Library. We constructed an educators' prosopography database, collected database construction suggestions from humanities scholars, and assessed their willingness to construct a digital humanities commons with us. Combined with the feedback, we found that humanities researchers are interested in digital humanities methods, but they need relevant tools training. Beijing Normal University Library can provide humanities scholars with training workshops on digital humanities concepts, methods, tools, platforms, and database construction, and the library is good at full-cycle data service including data collection, management, storage, and publishing. The library should strengthen data mining, text analysis, and visualization in the digital humanities study, focus on the authority and reliability of data, cooperate with humanities scholars to collect and verify data, and then enhance the library's influence in the academic community.",

        "Abstract": "Literature-based discovery (LBD) aims to discover valuable latent relationships between disparate sets of literatures. This paper presents the first inclusive scientometric overview of LBD research. We utilize a comprehensive scientometric approach incorporating CiteSpace to systematically analyze the literature on LBD from the last four decades (1986\u20132020). After manual cleaning, we have retrieved a total of 409 documents from six bibliographic databases and two preprint servers. The 35 years' history of LBD could be partitioned into three phases according to the published papers per year: incubation (1986\u20132003), developing (2004\u20132008), and mature phase (2009\u20132020). The annual production of publications follows Price's law. The co-authorship network exhibits many subnetworks, indicating that LBD research is composed of many small and medium-sized groups with little collaboration among them. Science mapping reveals that mainstream research in LBD has shifted from baseline co-occurrence approaches to semantic-based methods at the beginning of the new millennium. In the last decade, we can observe the leaning of LBD towards modern network science ideas. In an applied sense, the LBD is increasingly used in predicting adverse drug reactions and drug repurposing. Besides theoretical considerations, the researchers have put a lot of effort into the development of Web-based LBD applications. Nowadays, LBD is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary and involves methods from information science, scientometrics, and machine learning. Unfortunately, LBD is mainly limited to the biomedical domain. The cascading citation expansion announces deep learning and explainable artificial intelligence as emerging topics in LBD. The results indicate that LBD is still growing and evolving.",

Previous works and expert assessment recommend the adoption of an inclusive definition, with the aim of including all relevant uses of waste within this study. An ad-hoc designed 'capture' strategy has been used to retrieve WR-related peer-reviewed journal papers from selected databases, and the information contained in their author keyword field has been thoroughly cleaned. Author keyword co-occurrence data have been used for building a similarity measure between keywords, plus cluster analysis for revealing the main WR research being addressed by the scientific community. Results have been further analyzed using advanced visualization tools to determine which clusters formed strongly-linked research areas that could set the main cognitive divisions of WR science. This process has been repeated with 2002 and 2012 data, and science maps reflecting the main research areas and clusters have been generated. Results show that WR mainly deals with the recovery of basic, widely used raw materials like water and fertile soil. Energy generation and waste management are other relevant fields that show an interesting evolution, revealing signs of growth in research, together with the emergence of sub-areas reflecting consolidating research specialties.",

This toolkit helps biomedical researchers in information search by providing an overview of published literature content. Genescene is actually a knowledge source that incorporates published MEDLINE abstracts and allows retrieval and visualization of biomedical relations extracted from the content of the abstracts. Developers of this application hope that Genescene will facilitate the integration of information from more abstracts in a shorter time frame. Several techniques and knowledge sources are combined to develop software tools that provide researchers with relevant portions of text that are automatically extracted from relevant literature. The purpose of new technologies are to help researchers find information in a domain they are not familiar with and relate it back to their domain of expertise. The authors claim that, with Genescene, they want to provide researchers with a more complete picture of cellular processes by integrating relations from different related abstracts. They report that relations extracted by Genescene will be visualized in a comprehensive map. Users will be able to search for these relations with keyword-based searches. A linguistic parser and Concept Space automatically extract these relations between noun phrases from text.",

        "Abstract": "Developing a three-dimensional (3D) data model for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is an essential and complex issue. 3D modelling in GIS is becoming ever more important for the development of cyber cities and digital earth, which have recently become feasible. A competent 3D model forms an efficient foundation for 3D visualization, query and spatial analysis. As a development of the existing 3D models, this study proposes particular improvements in handling complex 3D objects. We present an object-oriented data model for handling complex 3D objects in GIS. First, the conceptual data model is developed based on the principle of object-oriented (OO) data modelling. This model is designed based on the following three basic geometric elements: node, segment and triangle. Accordingly, the abstract geometric objects are defined: including points, lines, surfaces and volumes. Second, the corresponding 3D logical model is designed based on the defined abstract objects and the relationships between them. Third, a formal representation of the 3D spatial objects is described in detail. Fourth, a prototype 3D GIS is developed based on the proposed 3D data model. Finally, we describe the results of an experimental study to reconstruct 3D objects using this 3D GIS and a comparison with the performance of other 3D data models. The proposed model is able to handle complex objects, such as complex buildings and TV towers, which is an essential functionality for building large-scale cyber cities, such as for Hong Kong. The proposed data model proves to be very efficient, particularly in visualization and rendering. The experimental results show which the data volume of the proposed model is compacted and the visualization speed for 3D objects is improved, compared with the existing models.",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Using 1,756 records of product-related location names in Products in Local Chronicles of Guangdong of the Qing dynasty, which are recognized by a name recognition system, as attribute data; taking the spatial data of Chinese administrative geography of the Qing dynasty in 1820 and the Historical Atlas of China as spatial data; connect the attribute data with relevant spatial data based on the table connection function of Arcmap in Arcgis 8.3 to implement the data management, cartography and analysis. Findings \u2013 The application of GIS in the development and utilization of ancient local chronicles was quite successful. With some thematic maps, knowledge about products distribution and dispersal in ancient books was vividly displayed so as to facilitate relevant researches. Research limitations/implications \u2013 Only product-related location names inside China were analyzed, not other named entities in local chronicles; and only static visual display was achieved, not dynamic visual display. Historical maps of the world can be used to carry out the visualization of the products distribution and dispersal in the world, and even the visualization of other knowledge, such as poetries and songs scattered over many places in China. The process of products dispersal and the distribution of poetries and songs can be dynamically and visually displayed by pictures, audios, videos, multimedia, etc. Practical implications \u2013 By using GIS in the development and utilization of Chinese ancient local chronicles, this paper explores a new way for the collation of ancient books and open up a new area for the research of digital humanities. Originality/value \u2013 This is the first try about the application of GIS in the development and utilization of ancient local chronicles, and also the same of digital humanities research in the field of agricultural history.",

        "Abstract": "Background: The analysis of subgroups in clinical trials is essential to assess differences in treatment effects for distinct patient clusters, that is, to detect patients with greater treatment benefit or patients where the treatment seems to be ineffective. Methods: The software application subscreen (R package) has been developed to analyze the population of clinical trials in minute detail. The aim was to efficiently calculate point estimates (eg, hazard ratios) for multiple subgroups to identify groups that potentially differ from the overall trial result. The approach intentionally avoids inferential statistics such as P values or confidence intervals but intends to encourage discussions enriched with external evidence (eg, from other studies) about the exploratory results, which can be accompanied by further statistical methods in subsequent analyses. The subscreen application was applied to 2 clinical study data sets and used in a simulation study to demonstrate its usefulness. Results: The visualization of numerous combined subgroups illustrates the homogeneity or heterogeneity of potentially all subgroup estimates with the overall result. With this, the application leads to more targeted planning of future trials. Conclusion: This described approach supports the current trend and requirements for the investigation of subgroup effects as discussed in the EMA draft guidance for subgroup analyses in confirmatory clinical trials (EMA 2014). The lack of a convenient tool to answer spontaneous questions from different perspectives can hinder an efficient discussion, especially in joint interdisciplinary study teams. With the new application, an easily executed but powerful tool is provided to fill this gap.",

        "Abstract": "With advances in computer graphics, a number of innovative approaches to information visualization have been developed (e.g., Card et al, 1991). Some of these approaches create a mapping between information and corresponding structure in a virtual world. The resulting virtual worlds can be fully three dimensional (3D) or they can be implemented as a series of 2D birds-eye \"snapshots\" that are traversed as if they were in 3D, using operations such as panning and zooming interactively (2.5D). This paper reports a study that contrasted 3D and 2.5D performance for people with differing levels of spatial and structure learning ability. Four data collection methods were employed: search task scoring; subjective questionnaires; navigational activity logging and analysis; and administration of tests for spatial and structure-learning abilities. Analysis of the results revealed statistically significant effects of user abilities, and information environment designs. Overall, this research did not find a performance advantage for using a 3D rather than a 2.5D virtual world, in addition, users in the lowest quartile of spatial ability had significantly lower search performance in the 3D environment. The findings suggest that individual differences in traits such as spatial ability may be important in determining the usability and acceptability of 3D environments.",

The videorecords were analyzed using a grounded theory approach to generate hypotheses related to comprehension difficulties and visualization properties. Our analysis of the results uncovered three properties that made problem solving more difficult for participants. These were: (a) cuts that were at an angle in relation to at least one plane of reference, (b) nonplanar properties of the features contained in the 3D visualizations including curved layers and v-shaped layers, and (c) mixed combinations of layers. In contrast, (a) cutting planes that were perpendicular or parallel to the 3 D visualization diagram's planes of reference, (b) internal features that were flat/planar, and (c) homogeneous layers were easier to comprehend. This research has direct implications for the generation and use of 3 D information visualizations in that it suggests design features to include and avoid.",

        "Abstract": "Based on the papers published in journals indexed by SCI/SSCI between 2008 and 2012, we studied the interdisciplinarity of iSchools and visualized publication portfolios among different journals and clusters. The findings indicate that the iSchools can be seen as interdisciplinary environments from a macroscopic perspective, but each individual iSchool has its own strengths and specializations. In many cases, the 'i' in the individual 'iSchool' can only be interpreted as 'information' not 'interdisciplinary'. The results also show that LIS-related journals still occupy the most important position in the research output of iSchools, although some iSchools with strong computer science background are members of this organization. This work is compared to earlier analyses and provides a different view of the state of the interdisciplinarity of iSchools.",

        "Abstract": "Visualization of scientific results using networks has become popular in scientometric research. We provide base maps for Mendeley reader count data using the publication year 2012 from the Web of Science data. Example networks are shown and explained. The reader can use our base maps to visualize other results with the VOSViewer. The proposed overlay maps are able to show the impact of publications in terms of readership data. The advantage of using our base maps is that it is not necessary for the user to produce a network based on all data (e.g., from 1 year), but can collect the Mendeley data for a single institution (or journals, topics) and can match them with our already produced information. Generation of such large-scale networks is still a demanding task despite the available computer power and digital data availability. Therefore, it is very useful to have base maps and create the network with the overlay technique.",

        "Abstract": "The complexity and size of geospatial data can constrain the capabilities of service providers and create risks to the long-term preservation and archiving of valuable information assets. While services-oriented architectures such as the Earth Data Analysis Center's Geographic Storage, Transformation and Retrieval Engine (GSToRE1) facilitate increased use and impact of geospatial data by mitigating these complexities by development of dynamic applications and interfaces, such services can often be primarily focused on the maintenance and delivery of only the most current versions of geospatial data that may nonetheless possess significant historical, cultural, or scientific value. Actions and documentation required to assure long-term preservation may not be supported by existing business models or may be otherwise compromised. However, general purpose archives offer a preservation capability that is complementary to the value created by dynamic service providers. We present an overview of the features of GSToRE, and the DSpace2repository platform and describe the requirements of a methodology for the harvest, quality assurance, and ingest of geospatial data into an institutional repository as a complement to the dynamic data access and visualization services provided by GSToRE and systems like it.",

        "Abstract": "In the information science literature, recent studies have used patent databases and patent classification information to construct network maps of patent technology classes. In such a patent technology map, almost all pairs of technology classes are connected, whereas most of the connections between them are extremely weak. This observation suggests the possibility of filtering the patent network map by removing weak links. However, removing links may reduce the explanatory power of the network on inventor or organization diversification. The network links may explain the patent portfolio diversification paths of inventors and inventing organizations. We measure the diversification explanatory power of the patent network map, and present a method to objectively choose an optimal tradeoff between explanatory power and removing weak links. We show that this method can remove a degree of arbitrariness compared with previous filtering methods based on arbitrary thresholds, and also identify previous filtering methods that created filters outside the optimal tradeoff. The filtered map aims to aid in network visualization analyses of the technological diversification of inventors, organizations, and other innovation agents, and potential foresight analysis. Such applications to a prolific inventor (Leonard Forbes) and company (Google) are demonstrated.",

        "Abstract": "This paper is based on statistical and qualitative analysis of library and information science (LIS) literature. Our study asks the question of whether, and if so, how, and how often, the discourse generated by scholarly literature in LIS engages discussion about identity in LIS, what topics are covered, and whether the articles engage praxis, or the application of theory to practice. Through searches in LISTA database that cross-referenced identity terms (e.g., Gender, LGBT) with terms describing prominent areas in the LIS field, we collected quantitative data and analyzed the co-occurrence of keywords and created network visualizations. We used a qualitative coding scheme to rate abstracts in terms of their relevance and actionability. Both modes of analysis show that generalized conversations about identity are most common, and praxis is rarely achieved. Using critical approaches to LIS, we explore the ramifications of silences within LIS literature upon the pedagogical and professional discourse.",

Clustering of users\u2019 navigation into sessions has been proposed in order to identify patterns and similarities which are then managed in the context of Web users oriented applications (searching, e-commerce, etc.). This paper deals with the problem of assessing the quality of user session clusters in order to make inferences regarding the users\u2019 navigation behavior. A common model-based clustering algorithm is used to result in clusters of Web users\u2019 sessions. These clusters are validated by using a statistical test, which measures the distances of the clusters\u2019 distributions to infer their dissimilarity and distinguishing level. Furthermore, a visualization method is proposed in order to interpret the relation between clusters. Using real data sets, we illustrate how the proposed analysis can be applied in popular application scenarios to reveal valuable associations among Web users\u2019 navigation sessions.",

        "Abstract": "Cultural heritage is increasingly being viewed as an economic asset for geographic areas who aim to capitalise in the surge in interest in local history and heritage tourism from members of the public. Digital technologies have developed that facilitate new forms of engagement with heritage and allow local areas to showcase their history, potentially broadening interest to a wider audience, thus acting as a driver for cultural and economic resilience. The research presented in this paper explores this through interdisciplinary research utilising laser scanning and visualisation in combination with social research in Elgin. 3D data capture technologies were used to develop and test 3D data visualisations and protocols through which the urban built heritage can be digitally recorded. The main focus of this paper surrounds the application and perceptions of these technologies. Findings suggest that the primary driver for cultural heritage developments was economic (with an emphasis on tourism) but further benefits and key factors of community engagement, social learning and cultural resilience were also reported. Stakeholder engagement and partnership working, in particular, were identified as critical factors of success. The findings from the community engagement events demonstrate that laser scanning and visualisation provide a novel and engaging mechanism for co-producing heritage assets. There is a high level of public interest in such technologies and users who engaged with these models reported that they gained new perspectives (including spatial and temporal perspectives) on the built heritage of the area.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Finding relevant publications is a common task. Typically, a researcher browses through a list of publications and traces additional relevant publications. When relevant publications are identified, the list may be expanded by the citation links of the relevant publications. The information needs of researchers may change as they go through such iterative processes. The exploration process quickly becomes cumbersome as the list expands. Most existing academic search systems tend to be limited in terms of the extent to which searchers can adapt their search as they proceed. In this article, we introduce an adaptive visual exploration system named PaperPoles to support exploration of scientific publications in a context\u2010aware environment. Searchers can express their information needs by intuitively formulating positive and negative queries. The search results are grouped and displayed in a cluster view, which shows aspects and relevance patterns of the results to support navigation and exploration. We conducted an experiment to compare PaperPoles with a list\u2010based interface in performing two academic search tasks with different complexity. The results show that PaperPoles can improve the accuracy of searching for the simple and complex tasks. It can also reduce the completion time of searching and improve exploration effectiveness in the complex task. PaperPoles demonstrates a potentially effective workflow for adaptive visual search of complex information.",

We aimed to integrate minimum span clustering ( MSC) and minimum spanning tree methods to cluster and visualize the global pattern of scientific publications ( PSP) by analyzing aggregated Science Citation Index ( SCI) data from 1994 to 2011. We hypothesized that PSP clustering is mainly affected by countries' geographic location, ethnicity, and level of economic development, as indicated in previous studies. Our results showed that the 100 countries with the highest rates of publications were decomposed into 12 PSP groups and that countries within a group tended to be geographically proximal, ethnically similar, or comparable in terms of economic status. Hubs and bridging nodes in each knowledge production group were identified. The performance of each group was evaluated across 16 knowledge domains based on their specialization, volume of publications, and relative impact. Awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of each group in various knowledge domains may have useful applications for examining scientific policies, adjusting the allocation of resources, and promoting international collaboration for future developments.",

The study combines performance analysis and science mapping for detecting and visualizing conceptual subdomains. Quantitative and qualitative measures are used in order to identify the most prominent themes. Quantitative data are used to put together very related concepts (themes or clusters of topics), while qualitative indicators (as those based on citations) are used to measure the quality and/or impact of the detected themes. The study also uses bibliometric maps to show in a visual way the associations between the main concepts treated by the CBR community. The maps provide insight into the structure of the CBR, visualize the division of the field into several subfields, and indicate the relationships between these subfields. Co-word analysis is the bibliometric technique used to identify the main themes. All this allows us to quantify and visualize the thematic evolution of the CBR. It also helps to both experts and novices to understand the current state of the art of the CBR and to predict where future research could lead.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: As the volume and breadth of online information is rapidly increasing, ad hoc search systems become less and less efficient to answer information needs of modern users. To support the growing complexity of search tasks, researchers in the field of information developed and explored a range of approaches that extend the traditional ad hoc retrieval paradigm. Among these approaches, personalized search systems and exploratory search systems attracted many followers. Personalized search explored the power of artificial intelligence techniques to provide tailored search results according to different user interests, contexts, and tasks. In contrast, exploratory search capitalized on the power of human intelligence by providing users with more powerful interfaces to support the search process. As these approaches are not contradictory, we believe that they can re-enforce each other. We argue that the effectiveness of personalized search systems may be increased by allowing users to interact with the system and learn/investigate the problem in order to reach the final goal. We also suggest that an interactive visualization approach could offer a good ground to combine the strong sides of personalized and exploratory search approaches. This paper proposes a specific way to integrate interactive visualization and personalized search and introduces an adaptive visualization based search system Adaptive VIBE that implements it. We tested the effectiveness of Adaptive VIBE and investigated its strengths and weaknesses by conducting a full-scale user study. The results show that Adaptive VIBE can improve the precision and the productivity of the personalized search system while helping users to discover more diverse sets of information.",

        "Abstract": "An integrative approach is taken to mapping the field of research on information literacy in health sciences and social sciences. The objective was to identify the conceptual structure of these areas, and to determine their main research fronts and descriptors, and the relationships between them. A further objective is to determine whether information literacy is a consistent area. The basis of the study is the use of the program VOSViewer to analyse the co-occurrence of the areas' descriptors, grouping them into clusters and generating a map of their connections. Information retrieval was by retrospective searches of the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) and Scopus (Elsevier). The results for the health sciences area yielded four clusters. The centralmost descriptor was Education (with a total link strength of 1,470), which was strongly linked to the descriptor ' Information retrieval', and weakly linked to ' Information skills', ' Information seeking', and ' Information Science'. In social sciences, there were six clusters. ' Information literacy' was now the descriptor with most occurrences (812) as well as having the greatest weight-a total link strength of 2,340-followed by ' Education' with 839 occurrences. The resulting maps provide a graphical identification of the main research issues and trends in information literacy in these two areas of expertise which, according to the data of the present study, correspond to lesser (health sciences) and greater (social sciences) scientific production. Information literacy was seen to be conceptually more consistent in health sciences than in social sciences. However, at least for the moment, it is a still growing conceptual space that is in need of solider indices of consistency and specificity.",

        "Abstract": "The emergence of COVID-19 spurred the formation of myriad teams to tackle every conceivable aspect of the virus and thwart its spread. Enabled by global digital connectedness, collaboration has become a constant theme throughout the pandemic, resulting in the expedition of the scientific process (including vaccine development), rapid consolidation of global outbreak data and statistics, and experimentation with novel partnerships. To document the evolution of these collaborative efforts, the authors collected illustrative examples as the pandemic unfolded, supplemented with publications from the JMIR COVID-19 Special Issue. Over 60 projects rooted in collaboration are categorized into five main themes: knowledge dissemination, data propagation, crowdsourcing, artificial intelligence, and hardware design and development. They highlight the numerous ways that citizens, industry professionals, researchers, and academics have come together worldwide to consolidate information and produce products to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, researchers and citizen scientists scrambled to access quality data within an overwhelming quantity of information. As global curated data sets emerged, derivative works such as visualizations or models were developed that depended on consistent data and would fail when there were unanticipated changes. Crowdsourcing was used to collect and analyze data, aid in contact tracing, and produce personal protective equipment by sharing open designs for 3D printing. An international consortium of entrepreneurs and researchers created a ventilator based on an open-source design. A coalition of nongovernmental organizations and governmental organizations, led by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, created a shared open resource of over 200,000 research publications about COVID-19 and subsequently offered cash prizes for the best solutions to 17 key questions involving artificial intelligence. A thread of collaboration weaved throughout the pandemic response, which will shape future efforts. Novel partnerships will cross boundaries to create better processes, products, and solutions to consequential societal challenges. JMIR Public Health Surveill 2021;7(2):e25935 doi:10.2196/25935",

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have been introduced in humanitarian operations in order to help with the significant challenges the sector is facing. This article focuses on chatbots which have been proposed as an efficient method to improve communication with, and accountability to affected communities. Chatbots, together with other humanitarian AI applications such as biometrics, satellite imaging, predictive modelling and data visualisations, are often understood as part of the wider phenomenon of 'AI for social good'. The article develops a decolonial critique of humanitarianism and critical algorithm studies which focuses on the power asymmetries underpinning both humanitarianism and AI. The article asks whether chatbots, as exemplars of 'AI for good', reproduce inequalities in the global context. Drawing on a mixed methods study that includes interviews with seven groups of stakeholders, the analysis observes that humanitarian chatbots do not fulfil claims such as 'intelligence'. Yet AI applications still have powerful consequences. Apart from the risks associated with misinformation and data safeguarding, chatbots reduce communication to its barest instrumental forms which creates disconnects between affected communities and aid agencies. This disconnect is compounded by the extraction of value from data and experimentation with untested technologies. By reflecting the values of their designers and by asserting Eurocentric values in their programmed interactions, chatbots reproduce the coloniality of power. The article concludes that 'AI for good' is an 'enchantment of technology' that reworks the colonial legacies of humanitarianism whilst also occluding the power dynamics at play.",

As work in computer science has begun to generate stories from low-level event/activity data, there is a need for systems that complement these tools to generate maps illustrating spatial components of these stories. While traditional maps display static spatial relationships, story maps need to not only dynamically display relationships based on the flow of the story but also display character perceptions and intentions. In this work, we study cartographic illustrations of historical battles to design a map generation system for reports produced from a multiplayer battle game log. We then create a story and ask viewers to describe mapped events and rate their own descriptions relative to intended interpretations. Some viewers received training prior to seeing the story, which was shown to be effective, though training may have been unnecessary for certain map types. Self-rating correlated highly with expert ratings, revealing an efficient proxy for expert analysis of map interpretability, a shortcut for determining if training is needed for story-telling maps or other novel visualisation techniques. The study's semantic questions and feedback solicitation demonstrate a process for identifying user-centric improvements to story-telling map design.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>The beginning of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic dates back to December 31, 2019, when the first cases were reported in the People's Republic of China. In the Czech Republic, the first three cases of infection with the novel coronavirus were confirmed on March 1, 2020. The joint effort of state authorities and researchers gave rise to a unique team, which combines methodical knowledge of real-world processes with the know-how needed for effective processing, analysis, and online visualization of data.<bold>Objective: </bold>Due to an urgent need for a tool that presents important reports based on valid data sources, a team of government experts and researchers focused on the design and development of a web app intended to provide a regularly updated overview of COVID-19 epidemiology in the Czech Republic to the general population.<bold>Methods: </bold>The cross-industry standard process for data mining model was chosen for the complex solution of analytical processing and visualization of data that provides validated information on the COVID-19 epidemic across the Czech Republic. Great emphasis was put on the understanding and a correct implementation of all six steps (business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment) needed in the process, including the infrastructure of a nationwide information system; the methodological setting of communication channels between all involved stakeholders; and data collection, processing, analysis, validation, and visualization.<bold>Results: </bold>The web-based overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic has been developed as an online platform providing a set of outputs in the form of tables, graphs, and maps intended for the general public. On March 12, 2020, the first version of the web portal, containing fourteen overviews divided into five topical sections, was released. The web portal's primary objective is to publish a well-arranged visualization and clear explanation of basic information consisting of the overall numbers of performed tests, confirmed cases of COVID-19, COVID-19-related deaths, the daily and cumulative overviews of people with a positive COVID-19 case, performed tests, location and country of infection of people with a positive COVID-19 case, hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19, and distribution of personal protective equipment.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The online interactive overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic was launched on March 11, 2020, and has immediately become the primary communication channel employed by the health care sector to present the current situation regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. This complex reporting of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic also shows an effective way to interconnect knowledge held by various specialists, such as regional and national methodology experts (who report positive cases of the disease on a daily basis), with knowledge held by developers of central registries, analysts, developers of web apps, and leaders in the health care sector.",

        "Abstract": "In ever-changing business environments, organizations continuously refine their processes to benefit from and meet the constraints of new technology, new business rules, and new market requirements. Workflow management systems (WFMSs) support organizations in evolving their processes by providing them with technological mechanisms to design, enact, and monitor workflows. However, workflows repositories often grow and start to encompass a variety of interdependent workflows. Without appropriate tool support, keeping track of such interdependencies and staying aware of the impact of a change in a workflow schema becomes hard. Workflow designers are often blindsided by changes that end up inducing side- and ripple-effects. This poses threats to the reliability of the workflows and ultimately hampers the evolvability of the workflow repository as a whole. In this paper, the authors introduce a change impact analysis approach based on metrics and visualizations to support the evolution of workflow repositories. They implemented the approach and later integrated it as a module in the HP Operations Orchestration (HP OO) WFMS. The authors conducted an exploratory study in which they thoroughly analyzed the workflow repositories of 8 HP OO customers. They characterized the customer repositories from a change impact perspective and compared them against each other. The authors were able to spot the workflows with high change impact among thousands of workflows in each repository. They also found that while the out-of-the-box repository included in HP OO had 10 workflows with high change impact, customer repositories included 11 (+10%) to 35 (+250%) workflows with this same characteristic. This result indicates the extent to which customers should put additional effort in evolving their repositories. The authors' approach contributes to the body of knowledge on static workflow evolution and complements existing dynamic workflow evolution approaches. Their techniques also aim to help organizations build more flexible and reliable workflow repositories.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose -- Conducting academic searches within online digital libraries can be a difficult task due to the complexity of the searcher's information need. The interfaces for such digital libraries commonly use simple search features that provide limited support for the fundamental strategies that academic searchers employ. The authors have developed a novel visualisation interface called Bow Tie Academic Search to address some of these shortcomings, and present in this paper the findings from a user evaluation. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach -- A controlled laboratory study was conducted to compare a traditional search interface to Bow Tie Academic Search. In total, 24 graduate students were recruited to perform academic searches using the two candidate interfaces, guided by specific sub-tasks that focus on citation and keyword analysis strategies. Findings -- Although the use of the core visualisation and exploration features did not reveal differences in retrieval effectiveness or efficiency, the query refinement features were found to be effective. Strongly positive impressions of usefulness and ease of use of all aspects of the system were reported, along with a preference for using Bow Tie Academic Search for academic search tasks. Originality/value -- This study provides insight into the potential value for providing visual and interactive interfaces for supporting academic search tasks and strategies. While the quantitative improvements over the traditional search interface were minimal, the qualitative measures illustrate the value of Bow Tie Academic Search.",

To validate the prototype, a qualitative evaluation was undertaken using multiple methods including a pilot study, focus groups, and individual interviews.

The prototype enhanced both assessment and feedback of AS from the physiotherapist\u2019s perspective and they believed it to be superior to the current methods used in practice for assessing the condition and in documenting variations for subsequent treatment. The physiotherapists believed that such a system had potential to encourage multidisciplinary working, and to be patient-centric, both with respect to the process of treatment and with regard to the convenience it offered to patients in managing their own condition. 3D visualization of AS symptoms and its treatment via exercise is a valuable technique as demonstrated by the prototype system.",

The literature output on information literacy was examined using the techniques of bibliometric analysis and information visualization. The literature considered was that constituted by the articles included in the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), Scopus (Elsevier), Library and Information Science Abstracts, and Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts databases. The occurrence of descriptors was analysed using VOSViewer, a program that groups them into clusters and generates a map of their connections. The results showed exponential growth of some 30 % annually between 2005 and 2011, with a mean of 14.45 documents per year. Spain, with 119 documents, was the top producing country, followed by Brazil with 76. The distribution of the more than 500 authors fitted a Lotka-law pattern, and the distribution of the 105 journals fitted the three zones of a Bradford-law pattern. The visualization map showed the 62 descriptors to group into seven clusters. For its centrality, there stood out 'Information literacy', strongly related with 'Information Science'. At the edge of the map were 'Digital literacy' and 'School library', indicative of their lack of any strong relationship with other terms. The 'Education', 'Knowledge management', 'Universities & colleges', and 'University libraries' descriptors were linked closely with the main IL theme.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>The electronic health record (EHR) contains a wealth of medical information. An organized EHR can greatly help doctors treat patients. In some cases, only limited patient information is collected to help doctors make treatment decisions. Because EHRs can serve as a reference for this limited information, doctors' treatment capabilities can be enhanced. Natural language processing and deep learning methods can help organize and translate EHR information into medical knowledge and experience.<bold>Objective: </bold>In this study, we aimed to create a model to extract concept embeddings from EHRs for disease pattern retrieval and further classification tasks.<bold>Methods: </bold>We collected 1,040,989 emergency department visits from the National Taiwan University Hospital Integrated Medical Database and 305,897 samples from the National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey Emergency Department data. After data cleansing and preprocessing, the data sets were divided into training, validation, and test sets. We proposed a Transformer-based model to embed EHRs and used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to extract features from free text and concatenate features with structural data as input to our proposed model. Then, Deep InfoMax (DIM) and Simple Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations (SimCLR) were used for the unsupervised embedding of the disease concept. The pretrained disease concept-embedding model, named EDisease, was further finetuned to adapt to the critical care outcome prediction task. We evaluated the performance of embedding using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to perform dimension reduction for visualization. The performance of the finetuned predictive model was evaluated against published models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC).<bold>Results: </bold>The performance of our model on the outcome prediction had the highest AUROC of 0.876. In the ablation study, the use of a smaller data set or fewer unsupervised methods for pretraining deteriorated the prediction performance. The AUROCs were 0.857, 0.870, and 0.868 for the model without pretraining, the model pretrained by only SimCLR, and the model pretrained by only DIM, respectively. On the smaller finetuning set, the AUROC was 0.815 for the proposed model.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Through contrastive learning methods, disease concepts can be embedded meaningfully. Moreover, these methods can be used for disease retrieval tasks to enhance clinical practice capabilities. The disease concept model is also suitable as a pretrained model for subsequent prediction tasks.",

This bibliometric study used Scopus citation database to collect articles. All public libraries articles indexed in Scopus were included. The downloaded records were analyzed by using Excel and VOS viewer. The results of the study revealed that the process of publishing public libraries articles was ascending and the number of documents reached from 4 in 1968 to 97 in 2017. The paper of Audunson R. (2005) entitled \"The public library as a meeting-place in a multicultural and digital context: The necessity of low-intensive meeting-places\" was the most highly-cited article. Bertot (28), United States (935), and Loughborough University (44) were the most productive author, country and university, respectively. Visualization showed that \"Public libraries\", \"libraries\", and \"public library\" were the most commonly used keywords in public library articles. In addition, the \"Public Library Quarterly\" was the most important source of articles publication. \"Public Library Quarterly\", \"Library Trends\", and \"Library Journal\" were the top journals, and \"Bertot\", \"Jaeger\" and \"McClure\" were the top authors cited in articles. This was the first study on the bibliometric analysis and visualization of public libraries articles. This study can help better perceive intellectual trends and dominant discourses in this area by providing researchers with a roadmap.",

Firstly, web usage and web structure mining are considered as an unique mining process to detect the latent structure of the web navigation across the web sections of a single portal. We extend association rules theory to web data defining new concepts of web (patterns) association and preference matrices, as well as of (indirect and direct) sequence rules. We identify the most significant rules, according to a multiple testing procedure. In the literature, web usage patterns can be visualized in no-distance-based graphs describing the navigation behavior across web pages with sequential arrows. In the following, we introduce a geometrical visualization of sequence rules at any click of the web navigation. In particular, we provide two distance-based visualization methods for the static analysis of all data tout court and the dynamic analysis to discover the most significant web paths click by click. A real world case study is considered throughout the methodological description.",

        "Abstract": "Information security has been a crucial issue in modern information management; thus cryptographic techniques have become inevitable to safeguard the digital information assets as well as to defend the invasion of privacy in modern information society, and likely to have far reaching impact on national security policies. This paper demonstrates the intellectual development of cryptographic research based on quantifiable characteristics of scholarly publications over a decade of the present century (2001 to 2010). The study critically examines the publication growth, authorship pattern, collaboration trends, and predominant areas of research in cryptology. Rank list of prolific contributors, productive institutions, and predominant countries have been carried out using fractional counting method. Strenuous efforts have been made to perform the activity index (performance indicator) of JOC, to determine the degree of collaboration in quantitative terms, to ascertain the collaboration density, as well as to test the empirical validation of Lotka's law in this scientific specialty. Major findings reveal that performance of JOC in cryptographic research corresponds precisely to the growth of world's publication activity (activity index = 1.1) over a decade of time; single-authored papers count only 25 % and average authorship accounts for 2.4 per paper; an increasing trend of multi-authored publications and a significant degree of collaboration (DC = 0.74) implies that cryptographers prefer to work in highly collaborative manner; author productivity distribution data partially fits the Lotka's law, when the value of \u03b1 (productivity parameter) approximated to 2.35 (instead of 2) and the number of articles does not exceed two. While large majority of collaborations constituted across the countries (56 %), then adequate amount of inter-country bilateral and multilateral collaboration signifies higher density or greater strength in the research network; most of the potential collaborators are emanated from 10 institutions of 5 different countries; however, cryptographic research is dominated by USA and Israel. More interestingly, vast majority among top-twenty ranked productive authors are affiliated in USA and Israel; Yehuda Lindell is found to be the most prolific author followed by Rosario Gennaro (USA), Tamir Tassa (Israel), Jonathan Katz (USA), etc.; Anglo-American institutions are more open than their overseas competitors; University of California (six centers) is placed on the top of the productive institutions. The study entails distinct subject clusters (research streams); and author-assigned keyword frequencies revealed that cryptanalysis, discrete logarithm, elliptic curve, block cipher, provable security, cryptography, secure computation, oblivious transfer, public-key encryption, zero-knowledge are more prevalent and active topics of research in cryptology. The implications of empirical results to the field are discussed thoroughly, and further analyzes are proposed to visualize this assessment in a better way.",

This article describes research that brought a group of designers into Wikipedia, with the goal of exploring how information designers act on this platform and how other users react to their involvement. Inspired by the WikiEdu Program, we engaged postgraduate design students in the creation of diagrams for Wikipedia and then followed the reactions of both users and designers to their work. The results of the experiment have been evaluated using built-in Wikipedia functions (e.g., page history and discussion pages) and through an anonymous survey among the students involved. This experience brought to light the different consideration granted to images and diagrams with respect to texts on the online encyclopedia. It also allowed a reflection on the role of designers in the knowledge production process, as well as on the meaning of producing \"open\" contents, which are meant to be improved by other people.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Precision cancer medicine (PCM) will require ready access to genomic data within the clinical workflow and tools to assist clinical interpretation and enable decisions. Since most electronic health record (EHR) systems do not yet provide such functionality, we developed an EHR-agnostic, clinico-genomic mobile app to demonstrate several features that will be needed for point-of-care conversations.<bold>Methods: </bold>Our prototype, called Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technology (SMART)\u00ae PCM, visualizes genomic information in real time, comparing a patient's diagnosis-specific somatic gene mutations detected by PCR-based hotspot testing to a population-level set of comparable data. The initial prototype works for patient specimens with 0 or 1 detected mutation. Genomics extensions were created for the Health Level Seven\u00ae Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)\u00ae standard; otherwise, the prototype is a normal SMART on FHIR app.<bold>Results: </bold>The PCM prototype can rapidly present a visualization that compares a patient's somatic genomic alterations against a distribution built from more than 3000 patients, along with context-specific links to external knowledge bases. Initial evaluation by oncologists provided important feedback about the prototype's strengths and weaknesses. We added several requested enhancements and successfully demonstrated the app at the inaugural American Society of Clinical Oncology Interoperability Demonstration; we have also begun to expand visualization capabilities to include cancer specimens with multiple mutations.<bold>Discussion: </bold>PCM is open-source software for clinicians to present the individual patient within the population-level spectrum of cancer somatic mutations. The app can be implemented on any SMART on FHIR-enabled EHRs, and future versions of PCM should be able to evolve in parallel with external knowledge bases.",

        "Abstract": "In the digital age, the amount of data is exploding. Taking \"quantitative analysis\" as the leading idea, many emerging methods and tools represented by quantity statistics, new database construction, and visual analysis as well as the network platforms are also emerging. Various tools are being built around computer data processing technology and applied to the study of premodern Chinese literature. The application of such new methods, tools, and platforms, combined with the traditional methods of close reading of texts and the professional knowledge of scholars, is forming a research method covering a wider range of texts with more traceable results. However, there is still no summary of the functions of these new methods, tools, and platforms, and a discussion on how they can be further integrated with the characteristics of the study of premodern Chinese literature. Based on this absence, this paper, by sorting out relevant concepts and analyzing existing research results, summarizes and examines the role of such new methods, tools, and platforms from the aspects of constructing basic research materials, interpreting literary phenomena and specific literary works, and judging research trends and emphases. Then, it analyzes the significance of the new paradigm in the study of premodern Chinese literature in the digital age.",

        "Abstract": "Historical events in the Republic of China era played an important role in the development of China. If digitized, connected, and analyzed within the scope of digital humanities, these historical events will provide a new perspective for the study of humanities. However, it is hard to construct a universal rule for description. This study aims to design an event-based ontology that models, organizes, and represents historical events in an explicit way. Procedures for the construction of the historical event-based ontology are as follows: identifying and selecting typical events based on trigger words, analyzing the constituent elements of historical events, reusing concepts and properties by referencing existing ontology vocabularies, establishing the historical event-based ontology model, and validating the model with actual historical data. The verification results of each type of event and each instance are displayed in visual forms. A representative historical figure associated with several types of events is selected, and the event relationship network is established. With great potential to be further developed, the model will help historical scholars deal with areas such as economic and micro-social history. Future research will input more complete data to enlarge the scale of the model.",

The review aims to (1) characterize the variety of evaluation methods used within the health informatics community and (2) identify best practices.<bold>Methods: </bold>A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. PubMed searches were conducted in February 2017 using search terms representing key concepts of interest: health care settings, visualization, and evaluation. References were also screened for eligibility. Data were extracted from included studies and analyzed using a PICOS framework: Participants, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, and Study Design.<bold>Results: </bold>After screening, 76 publications met the review criteria. Publications varied across all PICOS dimensions. The most common audience was healthcare providers (n\u2009=\u200943), and the most common data gathering methods were direct observation (n\u2009=\u200930) and surveys (n\u2009=\u200927).

Patient portals have the potential to enhance patient health engagement, but content might be misinterpreted.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aimed to discover whether the way of presenting blood test outcomes in an electronic patient portal is associated with patient health engagement and whether this varies across different blood test outcomes.<bold>Methods: </bold>A 2x3 between-subjects experiment was conducted among members of the Nivel Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel. All participants read a scenario in which they were asked to imagine themselves receiving blood test results. These results differed in terms of the presented blood values (ie, normal vs partially abnormal vs all abnormal) as well as in terms of whether the results were accompanied with explanatory text and visualization. Patient health engagement was measured both before (T0) and after (T1) participants were exposed to their fictive blood test results.<bold>Results: </bold>A total 487 of 900 invited members responded (response rate 54%), of whom 50.3% (245/487) were female. The average age of the participants was 52.82 years (SD 15.41 years). Patient health engagement saw either a significant decrease or a nonsignificant difference in the experimental groups after viewing the blood test results. The mean difference was smaller in the groups that received blood test results with additional text and visualization (meanT0 5.33, SE 0.08; meanT1 5.14, SE 0.09; mean difference 0.19, SE 0.08, P=.02) compared with groups that received blood test results without explanatory text and visualization (meanT0 5.19, SE 0.08; meanT1 4.55, SE 0.09; mean difference 0.64, SE 0.08, P<.001). Adding text and visualization, in particular, reduced the decline in patient health engagement in participants who received normal results or mixed results (ie, combination of normal and abnormal results).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Adding text and visualization features can attenuate the decrease in patient health engagement in participants who receive outcomes of a blood test via a patient portal, particularly when blood test results are (partly) normal. This suggests that explanatory text and visualization can be reassuring. Future research is warranted to determine whether these results can be generalized to a patient population who receive their actual blood test results.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Online social networks ( OSNs) have been built as platforms for information sharing, with their concomitant potential for misuse of information and unsafe sharing practices. The frontline of defense against such threats is the 'privacy settings' controls provided by OSNs such as Facebook. However, the efficacy of these settings is often undermined by their poor design. The current design fatigues users with information overload and fails to provide them with a more integrative and global understanding of their information-sharing practices. In this article, we develop a more efficacious design for the display of OSNs' privacy settings by following recommendations for appropriate use of visualization techniques. The new 'wheel' interface simplifies the presentation of privacy settings to reduce information overload. It also incorporates an additional layer of information, indicating the safety of users' settings. A within-subject experiment with 67 students suggests that this interface is more versatile than the current tabular interfaces typically used on OSNs. More important, it allows users to easily comprehend complex information and provides them with a more integrative, higher level understanding of their privacy settings. This research focuses on an important niche at the intersection of information representation, interface design, and OSN privacy.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of this work is to make a bibliometric analysis of anticancer research literature based on the data from the Web of Science. Anticancer drug research references published from 2000 to 2014 were used. Citespace software was employed to generate the knowledge maps of country/institution, cited authors, cited journals, co-words and cited references related with anticancer drug research. Results of this analysis indicated that the USA is the most productive country and the Chinese Acad. Sci. is the most productive institution in this field. Maeda H is the most influential author, leading the highest citation author group. 'CANCER RES' is the most cited journal in which the most influential anticancer drug research articles were published. Mosmann's paper is a representative and symbolic reference with the highest co-citation of number of 146 (centrality 0.29). The five hot anticancer drug research topics were also disclosed; they are: (1) chemotherapy drugs, (2) drug delivery, (3) bioscreening, (4) drug resistance research, and (5) enzyme inhibitor studies. Research frontiers identified included drug delivery with nanoparticles, controlled release, metabolism and so on. These analyses will be valuable for the reader to grasp an overall picture of anticancer research and research trends during these years.",

These multiple view information allows us to find a better pattern as long as we integrate them in an appropriate way. So clustering by integrating multi-view representations that describe the same class of entities has become a crucial issue for knowledge discovering. We integrate multi-view data by a tensor model and present a hybrid clustering method based on Tucker-2 model, which can be regarded as an extension of spectral clustering. We apply our hybrid clustering method to scientific publication analysis by integrating citation-link and lexical content. Clustering experiments are conducted on a large-scale journal set retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database. Several relevant hybrid clustering methods are cross compared with our method. The analysis of clustering results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, we provide a cognitive analysis of the clustering results as well as the visualization as a mapping of the journal set.",

The architecture is built according to a layered and modular methodology, which provides high scalability and interoperability with other information systems (HIS, RIS, etc). All the information is stored in a database: not only the various image studies of the patient, but also all data concerning the diagnosis and any comments the specialist may have made. We have also incorporated tools that are not usually found in conventional systems (image segmentation, advanced visualization, etc), but that help the specialist with the decision-making process.",

With researchers increasingly generating and referencing 3D data in their articles, the ability to accurately visualize that data in online publications has become extremely important. To address growing demands in online 3D visualization across various scientific domains and journals, Elsevier and Kitware launched a project to develop a 3D visualization infrastructure supporting different data formats, visualization techniques, and interaction styles for online scientific publishing. In this paper, we describe the expandable Hybrid Visualization Platform and five domain-specific 3D visualization viewers and present results of an author feedback survey. The presence of interactive 3D viewers embeddable in online articles is a key example of how the digital article format adds value to scientific communication and how it helps readers to better understand research findings and re-use the associated 3D data.",

The traditional citationbased indicators of a publication may not reflect the IR quality and have led to the creation of new indicators such as webometrics or web metrics. This study aims to analyse and explore Malaysia's public university IR visibility, the numbers of an external link, page count, PDF count and URL web mention. We utilised backlinks web crawler and web search engine to collect raw data. A visualisation was created using the force-directed graphing method to interpret the IR network in the webspace. This study revealed that two research universities, Universiti Malaya (UM) and Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), dominate web visibility based on webometrics indicators. All non-research universities are at the bottom of the rankings. This study shows institutional repositories from research universities are more visible in academic social networks and digital library sites. In contrast, non-research universities need to improve their visibility by mapping the universities' IRs websites through hyperlink exchange and collaboration activities between each university and promoting the university publication to the academic social network sites.",

        "Abstract": "The explosion of disaster health information results in information overload among response professionals. The objective of this project was to determine the feasibility of applying semantic natural language processing (NLP) technology to addressing this overload. The project characterizes concepts and relationships commonly used in disaster health-related documents on influenza pandemics, as the basis for adapting an existing semantic summarizer to the domain. Methods include human review and semantic NLP analysis of a set of relevant documents. This is followed by a pilot test in which two information specialists use the adapted application for a realistic information-seeking task. According to the results, the ontology of influenza epidemics management can be described via a manageable number of semantic relationships that involve concepts from a limited number of semantic types. Test users demonstrate several ways to engage with the application to obtain useful information. This suggests that existing semantic NLP algorithms can be adapted to support information summarization and visualization in influenza epidemics and other disaster health areas. However, additional research is needed in the areas of terminology development (as many relevant relationships and terms are not part of existing standardized vocabularies), NLP, and user interface design.",

Die im Rahmen des Projekts entwickelte Webseite bietet zahlreiche Sucheinstiege und Filter, eingebettete Tastaturen f\u00fcr arabische, kyrillische, griechische und lateinische Schrift sowie ein geografisches Informationssystem mit Visualisierungen und einem topografischen Index. During Bulgaria's national Revival in the 19th century, books were published in Bulgarian language for the first time since the beginning of the foreign occupation by the Ottoman Empire. Due to a general ban on printing presses in the Bulgarian speaking areas at the time, the books were printed in a huge geographical area, reaching from Moscow to New York. With the project \"Digitalization of the repertoire of books from the Bulgarian Revival (1801\u20131878)\", funded by the Bulgarian National Science Fund, the books of this period could be compiled in one comprehensive online bibliography for the first time. The entries are linked with the existing digitized full-texts of the various Bulgarian libraries and museums. The website developed within the project, offers various search filters, embedded keyboards for Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, and Latin script, as well as a geographic information system with visualizations and a topographic index.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Objective: </bold>Most electronic health records display historical medication information only in a data table or clinician notes. We designed a medication timeline visualization intended to improve ease of use, speed, and accuracy in the ambulatory care of chronic disease.<bold>Materials and Methods: </bold>We identified information needs for understanding a patient medication history, then applied human factors and interaction design principles to support that process. After research and analysis of existing medication lists and timelines to guide initial requirements, we hosted design workshops with multidisciplinary stakeholders to expand on our initial concepts. Subsequent core team meetings used an iterative user-centered design approach to refine our prototype. Finally, a small pilot evaluation of the design was conducted with practicing physicians.<bold>Results: </bold>We propose an open-source online prototype that incorporates user feedback from initial design workshops, and broad multidisciplinary audience feedback. We describe the applicable design principles associated with each of the prototype's key features. A pilot evaluation of the design showed improved physician performance in 5 common medication-related tasks, compared to tabular presentation of the same information.<bold>Discussion: </bold>There is industry interest in developing medication timelines based on the example prototype concepts. An open, standards-based technology platform could enable developers to create a medication timeline that could be deployable across any compatible health IT application.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The design goal was to improve physician understanding of a patient's complex medication history, using a medication timeline visualization. Such a design could reduce temporal and cognitive load on physicians for improved and safer care.",

To assess prognostic utility, we performed survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model, log-rank test, and Kaplan-Meier curves.<bold>Results: </bold>In both experiments, survival analysis revealed a statistically significant association between clusters and survival outcomes (A: overall survival, P\u2009=\u2009.0164; B: time from diagnosis to treatment, P\u2009=\u2009.0039). Multidimensional scaling separated clusters along a gradient mirroring the order of overall survival. Longer survival was associated with mutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGHV) status, absent Zap 70 expression, female sex, and younger age.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This approach to mixed-type data handling and selection of distance metric captured well-understood, binary, prognostic markers in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (sex, IGHV mutation status, ZAP70 expression status) with high fidelity.",

        "Abstract": "An enterprise geographic information system (EGIS) addresses the institutional challenge of providing common infrastructure to share geospatial data and associated services. We propose a comprehensive definition and conceptual framework for EGIS, and we apply this framework to analyze and assess the success of a prototype EGIS implementation. We define EGIS as institutional GIS capability with three attributes: (1) integrated components (common infrastructure); (2) services (shared data, analysis, modeling, and visualization capabilities); and (3) institutional management (administration and leadership). Further distillation yields nine specific implementation requirements: (1) common networked infrastructure; (2) high reliability and availability; (3) spatial data warehouse; (4) documentation of data and services; (5) coordination of dataflow and workflow; (6) coordination of personnel roles and responsibilities; (7) formalized management; (8) institutional financing; and (9) institutional leadership. We tested the hypothesis that a project-based GIS could be used as a prototype EGIS for a large institution. Evaluation of the Cerro Grande Rehabilitation Project GIS (CGRP-GIS), study system, yielded a comprehensive taxonomy of direct metrics (e.g., server downtime) and indirect metrics (e.g., increases in productivity) for evaluating EGIS. Some elements of the CGRP-GIS did not scale well to EGIS (e.g., management, financing, and leadership), since projects allocate resources primarily to achieve project goals, whereas EGIS allocates resources to long-term infrastructure. An EGIS, constructed on a solid conceptual framework, holds tremendous potential to advance sharing of geospatial data and associated services; to better allocate institutional and project resources; and to aid in problemsolving, communication, and decision making.",

In science, business, and now the humanities, the production and analysis of vast amounts of data (so-called 'big data research') have become fundamental activities. This article introduces the proj - ect 'A Big Data History of Music', a collaboration between Royal Holloway, University of London and the British Library. The project has made the British Library's catalogue records for printed and manuscript music available as open data, and has explored how the analysis and visualisation of huge numbers of bibliographic records can open new perspectives for researchers into music history. In addition to the British Library data (over a million records), the project drew on a further million bibliographic descriptions from RISM, which have also recently been released as open data. To show the challenges posed by the heterogeneous nature of the data, the article outlines the different structures of the various catalogue records used in the project, and summarises how the British Library data was cleaned and enhanced prior to its public release. Examples are given of how music-bibliographical data can be analysed and visualised, and how scholars and citizen scientists can engage with this data through hackathons, large-scale data analyses, and database construction. It is hoped this article will encourage other research libraries to consider making their catalogue records available as open data.",

        "Abstract": "This article presents a case study of the open data project in the Chicago area. The main purpose of the research is to explore empowering potential of an open data phenomenon at the local level as a platform useful for promotion of civic engagement projects and provide a framework for future research and hypothesis testing. Today the main challenge in realization of any e-government projects is a traditional top-down administrative mechanism of their realization itself practically without any input from members of the civil society. In this respect, the author of the article argues that the open data concept realized at the local level may provide a real platform for promotion of proactive civic engagement. By harnessing collective wisdom of the local communities, their knowledge and visions of the local challenges, governments could react and meet citizens' needs in a more productive and cost-efficient manner. Open data-driven projects that focused on visualization of environmental issues, mapping of utility management, evaluating of political lobbying, social benefits, closing digital divide, etc. are only some examples of such perspectives. These projects are perhaps harbingers of a new political reality where interactions among citizens at the local level will play a more important role than communication between civil society and government due to the empowering potential of the open data concept.",

        "Abstract": "Objective To describe HARVEST, a novel point-of-care patient summarization and visualization tool, and to conduct a formative evaluation study to assess its effectiveness and gather feedback for iterative improvements. Materials and methods HARVEST is a problem-based, interactive, temporal visualization of longitudinal patient records. Using scalable, distributed natural language processing and problem salience computation, the system extracts content from the patient notes and aggregates and presents information from multiple care settings. Clinical usability was assessed with physician participants using a timed, task-based chart review and questionnaire, with performance differences recorded between conditions (standard data review system and HARVEST). Results HARVEST displays patient information longitudinally using a timeline, a problem cloud as extracted from notes, and focused access to clinical documentation. Despite lack of familiarity with HARVEST, when using a task-based evaluation, performance and time-to-task completion was maintained in patient review scenarios using HARVEST alone or the standard clinical information system at our institution. Subjects reported very high satisfaction with HARVEST and interest in using the system in their daily practice. Discussion HARVEST is available for wide deployment at our institution. Evaluation provided informative feedback and directions for future improvements. Conclusions HARVEST was designed to address the unmet need for clinicians at the point of care, facilitating review of essential patient information. The deployment of HARVEST in our institution allows us to study patient record summarization as an informatics intervention in a real-world setting. It also provides an opportunity to learn how clinicians use the summarizer, enabling informed interface and content iteration and optimization to improve patient care.",

        "Abstract": "With organisations facing significant challenges to remain competitive, Business Process Improvement (BPI) initiatives are often conducted to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their business processes, focussing on time, cost, and quality improvements. Event logs which contain a detailed record of business operations over a certain time period, recorded by an organisation's information systems, are the first step towards initiating evidence-based BPI activities. Given an (original) event log as a starting point, an approach to explore better ways to execute a business process was developed, resulting in an improved (perturbed) event log. Identifying the differences between the original event log and the perturbed event log can provide valuable insights, helping organisations to improve their processes. However, there is a lack of automated techniques and appropriate visualisations to detect the differences between two event logs. Therefore, this research aims to develop visualisation techniques to provide targeted analysis of resource reallocation and activity rescheduling. The differences between two event logs are first identified. The changes between the two event logs are conceptualised and realised with a number of visualisations. With the proposed visualisations, analysts are able to identify resource- and time-related changes that resulted in a cost reduction, and subsequently investigate and translate them into actionable items for BPI in practice. Ultimately, analysts can make use of this comparative information to initiate evidence-based BPI activities.",

        "Abstract": "The K -Nearest Neighbor ( K -NN) search problem is the way to find the K closest and most similar objects to a given query. The K -NN is essential for many applications such as information retrieval and visualization, machine learning and data mining. The exponential growth of data imposes to find approximate approaches to this problem. Permutation-based indexing is one of the most recent techniques for approximate similarity search. Objects are represented by permutation lists ordering their distances to a set of selected reference objects, following the idea that two neighboring objects have the same surrounding. In this paper, we propose a novel quantized representation of permutation lists with its related data structure for effective retrieval on single and multicore architectures. Our novel permutation-based indexing strategy is built to be fast, memory efficient and scalable. This is experimentally demonstrated in comparison to existing proposals using several large-scale datasets of millions of documents and of different dimensions.",

        "Abstract": "Terminological resources play a central role in the organization and retrieval of scientific texts. Both simple keyword lists and advanced modelings of relationships between terminological concepts can make a most valuable contribution to the analysis, classification, and finding of appropriate digital documents, either on the web or within local repositories. This seems especially true for long-established scientific fields with elusive theoretical and historical branches, where the use of terminology within documents from different origins is often far from being consistent. In this paper, we report on the progress of a linguistically motivated project on the onomasiological re-modeling of the terminological resources for the grammatical information system grammis. We present the design principles and the results of their application. In particular, we focus on new features for the authoring backend and discuss how these innovations help to evaluate existing, loosely structured terminological content, as well as to efficiently deal with automatic term extraction. Furthermore, we introduce a transformation to a future SKOS representation. We conclude with a positioning of our resources with regard to the Knowledge Organization discourse and discuss how a highly complex information environment like grammis benefits from the re-designed terminological KOS.",

        "Abstract": "Objective There is a need to integrate the various theoretical frameworks and formalisms for modeling clinical guidelines, workflows, and pathways, in order to move beyond providing support for individual clinical decisions and toward the provision of process-oriented, patient-centered, health information systems (HIS). In this review, we analyze the challenges in developing process-oriented HIS that formally model guidelines, workflows, and care pathways. Methods A qualitative meta-synthesis was performed on studies published in English between 1995 and 2010 that addressed the modeling process and reported the exposition of a new methodology, model, system implementation, or system architecture. Thematic analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and data visualisation techniques were used to identify and cluster the underlying implementation 'challenge' themes. Results One hundred and eight relevant studies were selected for review. Twenty-five underlying 'challenge' themes were identified. These were clustered into 10 distinct groups, from which a conceptual model of the implementation process was developed. Discussion and conclusion We found that the development of systems supporting individual clinical decisions is evolving toward the implementation of adaptable care pathways on the semantic web, incorporating formal, clinical, and organizational ontologies, and the use of workflow management systems. These architectures now need to be implemented and evaluated on a wider scale within clinical settings.",

        "Abstract": "Computational technologies have become increasingly pervasive in recent decades. Computing research in academia has commensurately seen dramatic increases, both in computing-specific research and research using computing. This article maps out the academic computing landscape by examining the connections between computing-related keywords used to describe theses and dissertations. Specifically, data from 29,435 dissertations and theses found in the ProQuest Theses and Dissertation database in the years 2009-2014 were analyzed. Results identify interdisciplinary clusters, as well as identify key differences in connections between the four computing disciplines in the database: computer science (CS), computer engineering (CE), information technology (IT), and information science (ISci). For example, authors who primarily identify with CS rarely list secondary keywords, while authors from a high variety of other disciplines list CS as a secondary keyword. CE is tightly focused and growing, but rarely seen as a relevant secondary keyword by other fields. Meanwhile, the highly interdisciplinary nature of IT and ISci is shown, along with different subgroups within those areas. While the total number of unique theses with computing-related keywords has remained steady, they have shifted dramatically between specific computing fields (e.g., away from CS toward CE and IT). Visualizations present information on the growth and change in focus of computing-related theses and dissertations, as well as networks of keywords that co-occur. We discuss potential explanations of the patterns, as well as their implications on the future of graduate work in computing disciplines.",

More specifically, additional suitable representations that can enhance the utility of map-based visualizations are discussed. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed solution, we have developed a prototype map-based visualization system using Google Maps (GM), which demonstrates how additional representations can be beneficial.",

The studies generally use a within-subject design with 15 or more undergraduate students performing browsing to known-item tasks on sets of at least 1,000 full-text articles or Web pages on topics of general interest/news. Results of the meta-analysis (N = 8) showed no significant effects of the IV tool as compared with a text-only equivalent, but the set shows great variability suggesting an inadequate basis of comparison. Experimental design recommendations are provided which would support comparison of existing IV tools for IR usability testing.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose \u2013 This article aims to display the structure and reveal the web influence of institutions in the MENA zone, in geographic terms (country) and academic terms (universities), by means of their links. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Using search engines and webcrawlers designed to gather information about web links, in conjunction with visualization techniques and degree indicators based on social network analysis, the authors achieved their objective and found responses to a series of pertinent research questions. Findings \u2013 There is no direct relationship between the number of university websites and the number of inlinks. Linking between countries in the MENA zone obeys patterns of vicinity and geopolitics. Arab universities are interlinked following trends governed by territorial proximity. There is a strong endogamic tendency, with universities from a single country citing each other, particularly in the case of Saudi Arabia. The authors present the first ranking of web influence in the MENA zone based on network indicators, namely country and university, and their order is corroborated by comparison with other rankings of a webometric or scientometric nature. Research limitations/implications \u2013 Studies of this type cannot be undertaken again, at least not from the web link perspective, as Yahoo!, Google and Bing have since blocked the webcrawlers that attempt to carry out searches of inlinking or co-inlinking between/among sites. Hence, this work can be considered both a pioneer and the last of its kind. The authors do not know if or when it will be possible to again make queries about URLs in webs or, alternatively, in titles. Originality/value \u2013 This is the first visual report of the web structure underlying the countries and universities of the MENA zone. It is also the first time that a country and university ranking of this geopolitical zone has been carried out using network indicators based on web links.",

Availability, adequate visualization and analysis of spatially explicit data on socio-economic and environmental aspects can support both research and policy towards sustainable development. Applying appropriate mapping techniques allows gleaning important information from tabular socio-economic data. Spatial analysis of socio-economic phenomena can yield insights into locally-specific patterns and processes that cannot be generated by non-spatial applications. This paper presents techniques and applications that develop and analyze spatially highly disaggregated socio-economic datasets. A number of examples show how such information can support informed decision- making and research in Vietnam.",

The CTX invokes 2 positive feedback loops that utilize open source tools (DQe-c and Vue) to integrate technology and human actors in a system geared for increasing capacity and taking action. A pilot implementation of the system involved 6 ARCH partner sites between January 2017 and May 2018.<bold>Results: </bold>The ARCH CTX has enabled the network to monitor and, if needed, adjust its data management processes to maintain complete datasets for secondary use. The system allows the network and its partner sites to profile data completeness both at the network and partner site levels. Interactive visualizations presenting the current state of completeness in the context of the entire network as well as changes in completeness across time were valued among the CTX user base.<bold>Discussion: </bold>Distributed clinical data networks are complex systems. Top-down approaches that solely rely on technology to report data completeness may be necessary but not sufficient for improving completeness (and quality) of data in large-scale clinical data networks. Improving and maintaining complete (high-quality) data in such complex environments entails sociotechnical systems that exploit technology and empower human actors to engage in the process of high-quality data curating.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The CTX has increased the network's capacity to rapidly identify data completeness issues and empowered ARCH partner sites to get involved in improving the completeness of respective data in their repositories.",

Scope Automated summarization has been a long-studied subject in the fields of natural language processing and human-computer interaction, but the translation of summarization and visualization methods to the complexity of the clinical workflow is slow moving. We assess work in aggregating and visualizing patient information with a particular focus on methods for detecting and removing redundancy, describing temporality, determining salience, accounting for missing data, and taking advantage of encoded clinical knowledge. We identify and discuss open challenges critical to the implementation and use of robust EHR summarization systems.",

Author co-citation analysis (ACA) is a commonly used method to map knowledge domains and depict scientific intellectual structures. Although all authors' information has been considered in previous studies, ACA does not distinguish credits of different collaborators within a team. Authors' sequence in a publication illustrates their contributions and specialty of research, which offers more information as inputs of ACA. This paper considers author sequence in ACA and proposes a sequence-based ACA method. By assigning various weight values to authors with different sequences, this proposed method considers distinct contributions of co-authors influencing the effect of ACA. Extra weight is given to corresponding authors, beyond their sequence, to acknowledge their additional contributions. Results of the empirical study based on the data from the field of Library and Information Science show many details on the visualization maps of the proposed methods, such as the number of sub-fields, the position of sub-fields, the position of authors, and clarity and interpretability of visualization maps. Meanwhile, the current paper proposes a novel framework of evaluating knowledge domain maps with both quantitative and qualitative facets.",

Each of these systems has different data source and objectives for knowledge discovering. After preprocessing the available data in each case, data mining techniques can be applied: statistics and visualization; clustering, classification and outlier detection; association rule mining and pattern mining; and text mining.

        "Abstract": "Given a user-selected seed author, a unique experimental system called AuthorWeb can return the 24 authors most frequently co-cited with the seed in a 10-year segment of the Arts and Humanities Citation Index. The Web-based system can then instantly display the seed and the others as a Pathfinder network, a Kohonen self-organizing map, or a pennant diagram. Each display gives a somewhat different overview of the literature cited with the seed in a specialty (e.g., Thomas Mann studies). Each is also a live interface for retrieving (1) the documents that co-cite the seed with another user-selected author, and (2) the works by the seed and the other author that are co-cited. This article describes the Pathfinder and Kohonen maps, but focuses much more on AuthorWeb pennant diagrams, exhibited here for the first time. Pennants are interesting because they unite ego-centered co-citation data from bibliometrics, the TF*IDF formula from information retrieval, and Sperber and Wilson's relevance theory (RT) from linguistic pragmatics. RT provides a cognitive interpretation of TF*IDF weighting. By making people's inferential processes a primary concern, RT also yields insights into both topical and non-topical relevance, central matters in information science. Pennants for several authors in the humanities demonstrate these insights.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Despite the detailed patient package inserts (PPIs) with prescription drugs that communicate crucial information about safety, there is a critical gap between patient understanding and the knowledge presented. As a result, patients may suffer from adverse events. We propose using human factors design methodologies such as hierarchical task analysis (HTA) and interactive visualization to bridge this gap. We hypothesize that an innovative mobile app employing human factors design with an interactive visualization can deliver PPI information aligned with patients' information processing heuristics. Such an app may help patients gain an improved overall knowledge of medications. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of designing an interactive visualization-based mobile app using an HTA approach through a mobile prototype. Methods: Two pharmacists constructed the HTA for the drug risperidone. Later, the specific requirements of the design were translated using infographics. We transferred the wireframes of the prototype into an interactive user interface. Finally, a usability evaluation of the mobile health app was conducted. Results: A mobile app prototype using HTA and infographics was successfully created. We reiterated the design based on the specific recommendations from the usability evaluations. Conclusions: Using HTA methodology, we successfully created a mobile prototype for delivering PPI on the drug risperidone to patients. The hierarchical goals and subgoals were translated into a mobile prototype.",

For patent information, some special retrieval features such as chemical structure search (including Markush search), patent family references and citations search, biosequence search, and basic informetric functionality such as ranking, mapping, and visualization of information flows are realized. Considering the results of information science research, the practice of patent information shows unexhausted improvement opportunities (e.g., the application of bibliographic patent coupling and co-patent-citation for mapping patents, patent assignees, and technology specialties). For trademark search, users need multiple truncated search (realized) as well as phonetic search and image retrieval (not realized yet).",

In addition, this study aims to quantitatively analyze KM research trends, forecasts, and citations from 1993 to 2012 in Web of Science (WOS). Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A total of 12,925 documents related to KM research were collected from following databases: Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts & Humanities Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Social Science & Humanities. These documents were carefully reviewed and subjected to bibliometric data analysis techniques. Findings \u2013 A number of research questions pertaining to patterns in scientific outputs, subject categories and major journals, author keywords frequencies, characteristics of the international collaboration, most cited papers and significant papers distribution of KM research were proposed and answered. In addition, there are five research sights on KM research are as follows: management science, computer science, information science, business, and engineering. Based on these findings, many implications emerged that improve one's understanding of the identity of KM as a distinct multi-discipline scientific field. Research limitations/implications \u2013 Comprehensiveness and inclusiveness of the analyzed KM-related data set in WOS because of some KM-centric journals are not indexed by Thomson Reuters. Originality/value \u2013 The paper offers an overview and evaluation of research activity into the KM viewed through the WOS during 1993-2012.",

These migrations are by no means straightforward, particularly when one data schema must be mapped to another--or, when a database has been used in otherthan-its-intended manner. There are few tools or methods available to support the necessary work of comparing divergent data schemas. Here we present a proof-of-concept in which we compare two versions of a subset of the Specify 6 data model using Euler/X, a logicbased reasoning tool. Specify 6 is a popular natural history museum database system whose data model has undergone several changes over its lifespan. We use Euler/X to produce visualizations (called \"possible worlds\") of the different ways that two versions of this data model might be mapped to one another. This proof-of-concept lays groundwork for further approaches that could aid data curators in database migration and maintenance work. It also contributes to research on the unique challenges to knowledge organization within natural history museums, and on the applicability of logic-based approaches to database schema migration or crosswalking.",

Our technologies, KnoWare and InSpector, allow users to: collect reliable scientific measurements, map geo-tagged data, and intuitively visualize the results in real-time. KnoWare comprises a web portal and an iOS app with two core functions. First, users can generate scientific 'queries' that entail a call for information posed to a crowd with customized options for participant responses and viewing data. Second, users can respond to queries with their GPS-enabled mobile device, which results in their geo- and time-stamped responses populating a web-accessible map in real time. KnoWare can also interface with additional applications to diversify the types of data that can be reported. We demonstrate this capability with a second iOS app called InSpector that performs quantitative water quality measurements. When used in combination, these technologies create a workflow to facilitate the collection, sharing and interpretation of scientific data by non-expert scientists.",

        "Abstract": "Most data mining algorithms and tools stop at discovered customer models, producing distribution information on customer profiles. Such techniques, when applied to industrial problems such as customer relationship management (CRM), are useful in pointing out customers who are likely attritors and customers who are loyal, but they require human experts to postprocess the discovered knowledge manually. Most of the postprocessing techniques have been limited to producing visualization results and interestingness ranking, but they do not directly suggest actions that would lead to an increase in the objective function such as profit. In this paper, we present novel algorithms that suggest actions to change customers from an undesired status (such as attritors) to a desired one (such as loyal) while maximizing an objective function: the expected net profit. These algorithms can discover cost-effective actions to transform customers from undesirable classes to desirable ones. The approach we take integrates data mining and decision making tightly by formulating the decision making problems directly on top of the data mining results in a postprocessing step. To improve the effectiveness of the approach, we also present an ensemble of decision trees which is shown to be more robust when the training data changes. Empirical tests are conducted on both a realistic insurance application domain and UCI benchmark data.",

        "Abstract": "Background. In 2010, the Open University of Japan began offering a onesemester face-to-face digital literacy (DL) training course at each of its 50 study centers to help elderly students use personal computers (PC) and the Internet for study. A series of checklists was completed by students before and after each DL training course to assess their achievement. Objectives. This study identified the degree to which students' perceived information and communication technology (ICT) skills had changed one to three years after completion of the DL training course. It revealed which skills were retained and which skills declined. Methods. A survey questionnaire was sent to 2,112 students who took the DL training course and we received 1,153 responses. Questions focused on students' daily use of a PC and the Internet, and opportunities to learn DL skills after the training course. The same items were used in a checklist to assess ICT skills, and the two sets of data were compared to identify the level of retention of 18 ICT skills. Results. Overall, scores for 16 of the 18 ICT skills declined. It was found that students who used a PC and the Internet more frequently and those who continued learning by self-instruction or peer learning in the community retained their ICT skills. Contributions. Visualization of changing patterns in ICT skills helped identify insufficient elements of the DL training course. This information is useful in refining course content and in planning post-course support for DL training attendees.",

        "Abstract": "It is often necessary to compose a team consisting of experts with diverse competencies to accomplish complex tasks. However, for its proper functioning, it is also preferable that a team be socially cohesive. A team recommendation system, which facilitates the search for potential team members, can be of great help both for (a) individuals who need to seek out collaborators and for (b) managers who need to build a team for some specific tasks. Such a decision support system that readily helps summarize multiple metrics indicating a team (and its members) quality, and possibly rank the teams in a personalized manner according to the end users' preferences, thus serves as a tool to cope with what would otherwise be an information avalanche. In this work, we present Social Web Application for Team Recommendation, a general-purpose framework to compose various information retrieval and social graph mining and visualization subsystems together to build a composite team recommendation system, and instantiate it for a case study of academic teams.",

This article is based on interviews with activist groups in Elephant and Castle, South London, campaigning against a local urban regeneration scheme. The focus here is on contemporary history-making, and how archival material can be used to construct a useful past for the purposes of campaigning and activism. The paper will assess how archiving is used as a campaigning tool within housing struggles, and how the archive space is transformed into a site of resistance and contestation in this context. The paper will explore how archives are activated and used in the \u2018here and now\u2019 to mobilize, engage and provoke response. The paper emphasizes the idea of archives as a place and the activist as curator, considering what alternative uses of the archive offer to an activist community. Additionally, it explores how activists curate and collect archival information, examining the use of Freedom of Information as a collecting strategy, and how data curation and visualizations allow new interpretations of archival material to be imagined.",

        "Abstract": "Historically, science of science (Sci2) studies have been performed by single investigators or small teams. As the size and complexity of data sets and analyses scales up, a 'Big Science' approach (Price, Little science, big science, ) is required that exploits the expertise and resources of interdisciplinary teams spanning academic, government, and industry boundaries. Big Sci2 studies utilize 'big data', i.e., large, complex, diverse, longitudinal, and/or distributed datasets that might be owned by different stakeholders. They apply a systems science approach to uncover hidden patterns, bursts of activity, correlations, and laws. They make available open data and open code in support of replication of results, iterative refinement of approaches and tools, and education. This paper introduces a database-tool infrastructure that was designed to support big Sci2 studies. The open access Scholarly Database () provides easy access to 26 million paper, patent, grant, and clinical trial records. The open source Sci2 tool () supports temporal, geospatial, topical, and network studies. The scalability of the infrastructure is examined. Results show that temporal analyses scale linearly with the number of records and file size, while the geospatial algorithm showed quadratic growth. The number of edges rather than nodes determined performance for network based algorithms.",

Science overlay maps and a StreamGraph were used to visualize interdisciplinary evolution. Our study confirms that interdisciplinarity evolves mainly from neighbouring fields to distant cognitive areas and provides evidence of an increasing tendency of BMB researchers to cite literature from other disciplines. Additionally, from our results, we can see that the top potential interdisciplinary relations belong to distant disciplines of BMB; their share of references is small, but is increasing markedly. On the whole, these results confirm the dynamic nature of interdisciplinary relations, and suggest that current scientific problems are increasingly addressed using knowledge from a wide variety of disciplines.",

        "Abstract": "Information systems increasingly provide options for visually inspecting data during the process of information discovery and exploration. Little research has dealt so far with user interactions with these systems, and specifically with the effects of characteristics of the displayed data and the user on performance with such systems. The study reports an experiment on users' performance with a visual exploration system. Participants had to identify target graphs within a large set of candidate graphs by using visual filtering criteria that differed in their efficiency for reducing the number of candidate graphs. A pay-off matrix and a time limit served to motivate users to select filter criteria efficiently. Performance was measured as the number of correct identifications of target graphs within a time-limit, and the number, type and position of filter criteria selected for the search. Efficiency was somewhat biased by users' preference to select filter criteria sequentially, starting from the left to the right. Rational and experiential cognitive styles affected performance, and they interacted with learning and the types of filter criteria chosen. The study shows that not only visual search tools can be used effectively but also that data and user characteristics affect task performance with such systems.",

The network utilizes patient-specific administrative and laboratory data and is updated each time a new pathology test result becomes available. Electronic health records from 32\u2009634 patients admitted to a Sydney metropolitan hospital via the emergency department from July 2008 through December 2011 were used. The model was tested on 2011 data and trained on the data of earlier years.<bold>Results: </bold>The model achieved an average daily accuracy of 80% and area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82. The model's predictive ability was highest within 24 hours from prediction (AUROC\u2009=\u20090.83) and decreased slightly with time. Death was the most predictable outcome with a daily average accuracy of 93% and AUROC of 0.84.<bold>Discussion: </bold>We developed the first non-disease-specific model that simultaneously predicts remaining days of hospitalization, death, and readmission as part of the same outcome. By providing a future daily probability for each outcome class, we enable the visualization of future patient trajectories. Among these, it is possible to identify trajectories indicating expected discharge, expected continuing hospitalization, expected death, and possible readmission.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Bayesian Networks can model EHRs to provide real-time forecasts for patient outcomes, which provide richer information than traditional independent point predictions of length of stay, death, or readmission, and can thus better support decision making.",

Research in electro-tactile pattern perception has shown that involving the resources of visual cortex into acquisition of tactile percepts augments comprehension of the encoded information for users with a sensory limitation. This paper describes matching software designed to facilitate the learning process of 13 electro-tactile patterns (eTPs) denoting eight math numbers and five arithmetic operators. Electro-tactile unit and software were used to shape stabilized monophasic current pulses provided through the pen coated with embedded double-strip ring type electrode. The performance of ten subjects was investigated in terms of the number of repetitions required to memorize and match the eTPs, and in terms of the recognition error committed in the matching phase of the test. The analysis of the data collected indicated that the novice-to-expert transition was significantly above chance when the results obtained in the first and the last test sessions were statistically compared. A permutation puzzle game which was also designed to induce the same ten blindfolded players to mobilize the perceptive skills and deploy individual playing tactics to manipulate the eTPs encoding math numbers and expressions for rebuilding simple arithmetic equations. The results of the use of the proposed gameplay technique are discussed. Upon learning and training, the eTPs could be employed to assign math numbers and arithmetic operators to communicate mathematics content.",

        "Abstract": "Characterizing the structure of knowledge, the evolution of research topics, and the emergence of topics has always been an important part of information science (IS). Our previous scientometric review of IS provided a snapshot of this fast-growing field up to the end of 2008. This new study aims to identify emerging trends and new developments appearing in the subsequent 7574 articles published in 10 IS journals between 2009 and 2016, including 20,960 references. The results of a document co-citation analysis show great changes in the research topics in the IS domain. The positions of certain core topics found in the previous study, namely, information retrieval, webometrics, and citation behavior, have been replaced by scientometric indicators (H-index), citation analysis (citation performance and bibliometrics), scientific collaboration, and information behavior in the most recent period of 2009-2016. Dual-map overlays of journals show that the knowledge base of IS research has shifted considerably since 2010, with emerging topics including scientific evaluation indicators, altmetrics, science mapping and visualization, bibliometrics, citation analysis, and scientific collaboration.",

These 1024 \u00d7 1024 px images give a quick overview of a trial's participants, design, and key findings. These visual abstracts are designed to help busy health professionals and researchers get a quick overview of newly published research. The present article describes simple pragmatic evaluations of these visual abstracts: analysis of social media stats and an opportunistic reader survey. Our goals were to identify how useful our readers found this new visual format, and whether there were any improvements we could make. The social media stats were initially very promising. Longer term performance over several visual abstracts, however, was not as strong, suggesting a possible halo effect provided by the novelty of a new presentation format. The survey proved to be a quick and valuable way of getting feedback on the design of the initial template, and resulted in several design adjustments.",

        "Abstract": "The continuing growth of scientific publications has posed a double-challenge to researchers, to not only grasp the overall research trends in a scientific domain, but also get down to research details embedded in a collection of core papers. Existing work on science mapping provides multiple tools to visualize research trends in domain on macro-level, and work from the digital humanities have proposed text visualization of documents, topics, sentences, and words on micro-level. However, existing micro-level text visualizations are not tailored for scientific paper corpus, and cannot support meso-level scientific reading, which aligns a set of core papers based on their research progress, before drilling down to individual papers. To bridge this gap, the present paper proposes LitStoryTeller+, an interactive system under a unified framework that can support both meso-level and micro-level scientific paper visual storytelling. More specifically, we use entities (concepts and terminologies) as basic visual elements, and visualize entity storylines across papers and within a paper borrowing metaphors from screen play. To identify entities and entity communities, named entity recognition and community detection are performed. We also employ a variety of text mining methods such as extractive text summarization and comparative sentence classification to provide rich textual information supplementary to our visualizations. We also propose a top-down story-reading strategy that best takes advantage of our system. Two comprehensive hypothetical walkthroughs to explore documents from the computer science domain and history domain with our system demonstrate the effectiveness of our story-reading strategy and the usefulness of LitStoryTeller+.",

Safety data are traditionally reported in a tabular or listing format, which often translates into many pages of static displays. This poses the risk that clinically relevant signals will be obscured by the sheer volume of data reported. Interactive graphics enable the delivery of the vast scope of information found in traditional reports, but allow the user to interact with the charts in real time, focusing on signals of interest. Methods: Clinical research staff, including biostatisticians, project managers, and a medical monitor, were consulted to guide the development of a set of interactive data visualizations that enable key safety assessments for participants. The resulting \u201cSafety Explorer\u201d is a set of 6 interactive, web-based, open source tools designed to address the shortcomings of traditional, static reports for safety monitoring. Results: The Safety Explorer is freely available on GitHub as individual JavaScript libraries: Adverse Event Explorer, Adverse Event Timelines, Safety Histogram, Safety Outlier Explorer, Safety Results Over Time, and Safety Shift Plot; or in a single combined framework: Safety Explorer Suite. The suite can also be utilized through its R interface, the safetyexploreR package. Conclusions: The Safety Explorer provides interactive charts that contain the same information available in standard displays, but the interactive interface allows for improved exploration of patterns and comparisons. Medical Monitors, Safety Review Boards, and Project Teams can use these tools to effectively track and analyze key safety variables and study endpoints.",

In the present work we propose a content-based technique to automatically generate a semantic representation of the user\u2019s musical preferences directly from audio. Starting from an explicit set of music tracks provided by the user as evidence of his/her preferences, we infer high-level semantic descriptors for each track obtaining a user model. To prove the benefits of our proposal, we present two applications of our technique. In the first one, we consider three approaches to music recommendation, two of them based on a semantic music similarity measure, and one based on a semantic probabilistic model. In the second application, we address the visualization of the user\u2019s musical preferences by creating a humanoid cartoon-like character \u2013 the Musical Avatar \u2013 automatically inferred from the semantic representation. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of the proposed technique in the context of these applications with 12 subjects. The results are promising: the recommendations were positively evaluated and close to those coming from state-of-the-art metadata-based systems, and the subjects judged the generated visualizations to capture their core preferences. Finally, we highlight the advantages of the proposed semantic user model for enhancing the user interfaces of information filtering systems.",

Three user groups - novices, online searching experts, and VIBE system experts - totaling 31 participants, were asked to use and compare VIBE to a more traditional text-based system, askSam. No significant differences were found; however, significant performance differences were found for some tasks on the two systems. Participants understood the basic principles underlying VIBE although they generally favored the askSam system. The findings suggest that VIBE is a learnable system and its components have pragmatic application to the development of visualized information retrieval systems. Further research is recommended to maximize the retrieval potential of JR visualization systems.",

To study the synergic network of high quality research patterns, this paper collects a total of 300 top 50 items, in each indicator from the big database, Essential Science Indicators, which lists top-ranking papers, scientists and institutions from 2005 to 2015. First, the country level relations of co-authorship addresses in five indicator variables are extracted in the field of social sciences to build international collaboration networks. The social network analysis (SNA) method was applied to calculate the metrics of vertices, edges, average degree, average shortest path, diameter, clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality to illuminate the structural characters and collaboration patterns. Based on the international collaboration similarities, this paper also visualizes the endemic clustering groups of six networks, as cluster dendrograms, using Hierarchical Clustering (HC) method. Findings illustrate that USA, England and Canada are outstanding countries in the international collaboration networks of five indicators. There are geographical groups in European countries in the collaboration networks of scientists, institutes and countries/territories. It is also found that international collaboration contributes to both highly cited papers in the recent 10 years and hot papers in the recent 2 years in this field, rather than geographical similarity does. Those conclusions are critical for policy makers to produce guidelines on how to encourage researchers to build collaboration networks with high-level scholars in different countries.",

This paper aims to discuss a range of impact measures, especially usage-based metrics, and to report the results of two surveys. Design/methodology/approach - The first part of the article analyzes both citation-based and usage-based metrics. The second part is based on the findings of the surveys: one in the form of a brainstorming session with information professionals and scientists at the OAI6 conference in Geneva, the second in the form of expert interviews, mainly with scientists. Findings - The results of the surveys indicate an interest in the social aspects of science, like visualizations of social graphs both for persons and their publications. Furthermore, usage data are considered an appropriate measure to describe quality and coverage of scientific documents; admittedly, the consistence of usage information among repositories has to be kept in mind. The scientists who took part in the survey also asked for community services, assuming these might help to identify relevant scientific information more easily. Some of the other topics of interest were personalization or easy submission procedures. Originality/value - This paper delineates current discussions about citation-based and usage-based metrics. Based on the results of the surveys, it depicts which functionalities could enhance repositories, what features are required by scientists and information professionals, and whether usage-based services are considered valuable. These results also outline some elements of future repository research.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: This study is an attempt to evaluating the growth of scientific literature in the domain of coronavirus and Covid-19 pandemic research based on scientometric indicators: prolific countries and relative citation impact (RCI); influential institutions; author analysis and network, h-index and citation; DC (degree of collaboration), CC (collaboration coefficient), MCI (modified collaboration index) in the subject domain of coronavirus and Covid-19 research. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted approaches to obtain the literature data from Scopus database from 2000 to 2020 by conducting a systematic search using keywords related to the studied subject domain. In total, 15,297 numbers of records were considered for the literature analysis considering the real significant growth of this subject domain. This study presented the scientometric analysis of these publications. Furthermore, statistical correlations have been used to understand the collaboration pattern. Visualization tool VOSviewer is used to construct the co-author network. Findings: The present study found that 53.57% (8,195) of the research documents published on the open-access platform. Journal of Virology was found to be most preferred journal by the researcher producing around 839(5.48%) articles. USA and China dominate in the research output, and the University of Hong Kong has produced the highest number of research paper 547(3.58%). A significant portion of the research documents are published in the subject domain of medicine (49.70%), followed by immunology and microbiology (35.72%), and biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology subject domains (22.32%). There has been an unparalleled proliferation of publications on COVID-19 since January 2020 and also a significant distribution of research funds across the globe. Research limitations/implications: The study exclusively examines 15,297 research outputs which have been indexed in the Scopus database from 2000 to 2020 (till 01 April 2020). Thus, documents published in any other different channels and sources which are not covered in Scopus are excluded from the purview of research. Practical implications: It will be beneficial for researchers and practitioners worldwide for understanding the growth of scientific literature in the coronavirus and COVID-19 and identifying potential collaborator. Originality/value: Considering the global impact and social distress due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, this study is significant in the present scenario for identifying the growth of scientific literature in this field and evolving of this domain of research around the globe. The research results are useful to identify valuable research patterns from publications and of developments in the field of coronavirus and COVID-19.",

        "Abstract": "We compare the network of aggregated journal-journal citation relations provided by the Journal Citation Reports ( JCR) 2012 of the S cience Citation Index ( SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index ( SSCI) with similar data based on Scopus 2012. First, global and overlay maps were developed for the 2 sets separately. Using fuzzy-string matching and ISSN numbers, we were able to match 10,524 journal names between the 2 sets: 96.4% of the 10,936 journals contained in JCR, or 51.2% of the 20,554 journals covered by Scopus. Network analysis was pursued on the set of journals shared between the 2 databases and the 2 sets of unique journals. Citations among the shared journals are more comprehensively covered in JCR than in Scopus, so the network in JCR is denser and more connected than in Scopus. The ranking of shared journals in terms of indegree (i.e., numbers of citing journals) or total citations is similar in both databases overall ( Spearman rank correlation \u03c1 > 0.97), but some individual journals rank very differently. Journals that are unique to Scopus seem to be less important-they are citing shared journals rather than being cited by them-but the humanities are covered better in Scopus than in JCR.",

Hyperlinks within a hyperlink-based document can be visualized in a two-dimensional visual space. All links are projected within a display sphere in the visual space. The relationship between a specified central document and its hyperlinked documents is visually presented in the visual space. In addition, users are able to define a group of subjects and to observe relevance between each subject and all hyperlinked documents via movement of that subject around the display sphere center. WebStar allows users to dynamically change an interest center during navigation. A retrieval mechanism is developed to control retrieved results in the visual space. Impact of movement of a subject on the visual document distribution is analyzed. An ambiguity problem caused by projection is discussed. Potential applications of this visualization model in information retrieval are included. Future research directions on the topic are addressed.",

Firstly, it collects the literature data of the core database of Web of Science from 2003 to 2018. Then it uses the literature co-occurrence method, knowledge mapping method, and content analysis method, and analyzes the current situation of supply chain management under the perspective of social network. It also applies Citespace software and bibliographic co-existing analysis system to analyze the literature cooperation network and topic in this field. Results showed that there are three important research angles, including the analysis of supply chain network members of the supply chain and the construction of sustainable supply chain network. Based on the knowledge mapping, this study is still relatively macro and cannot cover all areas of supply chain management. This study only investigated the state of correlational research in WOS and Google Trends and not additional databases. However, the research on dynamic network relationship and structure measurement is still lacking.",

        "Abstract": "Systems for landscape visualization and geographical data handling require methods for efficient data access. Retrieval of data from large geographical databases, ten to thousands of Gbytes, is usually optimized with spatial indexing mechanisms. The simplest form of spatial indexing is achieved by dividing the database into congruent grid cells. The subsequent subdivision of the grid cells can be based on so-called quadtrees. Quadtrees for two-dimensional division and subdivision are appropriate for cartographical data. A geographical database, with objects stored in geocentric or geodetic (geographical) co-ordinates, requires indexing mechanisms that take into account the shape of the Earth. In this paper, we present a method for indexing of geographical data, named Ellipsoidal Quadtrees (EQT). In contrast to other global indexing methods, EQT is based on the Earth ellipsoid and not a spherical approximation. EQT division and subdivision make it possible to divide the Earth surface into a mesh of quadrangles with equal areas. We will demonstrate that EQT is flexible. It can be used for indexing databases of various sizes, including national and global databases. Tests on real data show that the performance of EQT is good.",

Harvest incorporates visualizations of highly dimensional data in a web-based interface that promotes rapid exploration and export of any type of biomedical information, without exposing researchers to underlying data models. We evaluated Harvest with two cases: clinical data from pediatric cardiology and demonstration data from the OpenMRS project. Harvest's architecture and public open-source code offer a set of rapid application development tools to build data discovery applications for domain-specific biomedical data repositories.

This study focused on the development of an augmented reality (AR)-based rehabilitation training system to improve the spatial visualization and mental rotation abilities of elderly people. Using one's imagination to manipulate objects is common in everyday life. However, training tasks for the elderly are still presented in two-dimension, which research indicates generates a cognitive load that reduces the participants' interest and diminishes the effects of training. AR can effectively reduce cognitive load, improve one's sense of spatial direction, and increase participants' interest in training. Therefore, this study used AR technology, combined with a tangible user interface as a manual controller, to allow participants to directly manipulate a virtual three-dimensional model that used a cube to conduct mental rotation tasks (MRT) for the elderly to improve their mental rotation ability. After 6 weeks of intervention, we used an ABA (reversal) design and paired-sample t tests in SPSS to compare the learning effects on the experimental group's pre- and posttests. The participants' error rates significantly declined and their reaction times significantly improved during the MRT test.",

        "Abstract": "Motivation: High-throughput biological research requires simultaneous visualization as well as analysis of genomic data, e.g. read alignments, variant calls and genomic annotations. Traditionally, such integrative analysis required desktop applications operating on locally stored data. Many current terabyte-size datasets generated by large public consortia projects, however, are already only feasibly stored at specialist genome analysis centers. As even small laboratories can afford very large datasets, local storage and analysis are becoming increasingly limiting, and it is likely that most such datasets will soon be stored remotely, e.g. in the cloud. These developments will require web-based tools that enable users to access, analyze and view vast remotely stored data with a level of sophistication and interactivity that approximates desktop applications. As rapidly dropping cost enables researchers to collect data intended to answer questions in very specialized contexts, developers must also provide software libraries that empower users to implement customized data analyses and data views for their particular application. Such specialized, yet lightweight, applications would empower scientists to better answer specific biological questions than possible with general-purpose genome browsers currently available.Results: Using recent advances in core web technologies (HTML5), we developed Scribl, a flexible genomic visualization library specifically targeting coordinate-based data such as genomic features, DNA sequence and genetic variants. Scribl simplifies the development of sophisticated web-based graphical tools that approach the dynamism and interactivity of desktop applications.Availability and implementation: Software is freely available online at http://chmille4.github.com/Scribl/ and is implemented in JavaScript with all modern browsers supported.Contact: gabor.marth@bc.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

        "Abstract": "One of the most serious bottlenecks in the scientific workflows of biodiversity sciences is the need to integrate data from different sources, software applications, and services for analysis, visualisation and publication. For more than a quarter of a century the TDWG Biodiversity Information Standards organisation has a central role in defining and promoting data standards and protocols supporting interoperability between disparate and locally distributed systems. Although often not sufficiently recognized, TDWG standards are the foundation of many popular Biodiversity Informatics applications and infrastructures ranging from small desktop software solutions to large scale international data networks. However, individual scientists and groups of collaborating scientist have difficulties in fully exploiting the potential of standards that are often notoriously complex, lack non-technical documentations, and use different representations and underlying technologies. In the last few years, a series of initiatives such as Scratchpads, the EDIT Platform for Cybertaxonomy, and biowikifarm have started to implement and set up virtual work platforms for biodiversity sciences which shield their users from the complexity of the underlying standards. Apart from being practical work-horses for numerous working processes related to biodiversity sciences, they can be seen as information brokers mediating information between multiple data standards and protocols. The ViBRANT project will further strengthen the flexibility and power of virtual biodiversity working platforms by building software interfaces between them, thus facilitating essential information flows needed for comprehensive data exchange, data indexing, web-publication, and versioning. This work will make an important contribution to the shaping of an international, interoperable, and user-oriented biodiversity information infrastructure.",

        "Abstract": "Students in higher education environments typically work with information discovered to gain and create knowledge required for their assessments and other course work. Much of this research happens online now as a required activity for students at all education levels and settings. When students access study material via the Internet and without the presence of an instructor, they may face difficulties in understanding the complete purpose of an assessment. Such difficulties can lead to poor information search practices resulting in poor creativity and low knowledge gain, which may in turn lead to mediocre information synthesis and low levels of knowledge creation. To investigate and possibly address this problem, the current study examines the information search practices of 10 novice and 5 experienced university students as they seek to gain and create knowledge for authentic assessment tasks. An additional five students received an intervention in the form of a word cloud application, which was introduced to create a visual and textual task understanding support scaffolding for the students. Results revealed evidence of knowledge gain and creation, especially by most experienced students when they used mental models to derive their searching process, and when they used notes to convert the implicit knowledge into an explicit form. The word cloud intervention additionally provided experienced students relevant learning cues from the task to improve their knowledge gain and creation, and helped improve their engagement with the online assessments tasks.",

        "Abstract": "\u2022 We propose SNSJam, which is a system to detect and predict road traffic jams by leveraging multiple data sources, specifically Twitter and Instagram. \u2022 SNSJam supports multiple languages, specifically Arabic and English. It also supports Standard Arabic and UAE local Dialect. \u2022 We developed a location recognizer that identifies locations from the text of posts and/or GPS locations. SNSJam supports user-defined locations, which are common names among people but different from the official names. SNSJam is the first such system to define and support user-defined locations. \u2022 We developed a context-aware classifier to detect traffic jams. The classifier is able to identify the cause of traffic jams. The detected traffic jams can be visualized through a dynamic map. \u2022 SNSJam employs a linear regression model to predict future traffic jams by leveraging current and historical posts. The increased popularity of micro-blogging applications together with the widespread of location-aware devices have resulted in the creation of large streams of geo-tagged data. Such data provides a great opportunity for researchers to explore event detection and prediction. In particular, road traffic detection and prediction are of great importance to various applications, i.e. Intelligent Transportation Systems. Current works proposed traffic jam detection from a single data source with a single language. However, for countries where the residents are speaking two, or more, languages and are interacting with more than one online social platform, single-language and single-source systems are insufficient to capture the necessary online information. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce SNSJam, an effective system to detect and predict road traffic jams using cross-lingual (English and Arabic) data collected from multiple dynamic sources, such as Twitter and Instagram. SNSJam classifier not only detect traffic events, but also identifies the causes of traffic jams. To identify the location of a traffic event, a Location Recognizer is developed that extracts locations from text and GPS of the post. Additionally, the Location Recognizer supports user-defined locations, which are common names among people. Our experiments show that by combining Arabic and English data streams, the accuracies of traffic events detection and prediction are significantly improved as compared with that of the individual languages. Additionally, combining data streams from multiple sources (Twitter and Instagram) further improved the accuracies of event detection and prediction over any individual source. A visualization interface was developed to show the detected spatio-temporal traffic events on a dynamic map. The detection and prediction results are validated against ground truth data obtained from the concerned authorities in the UAE.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: In information systems that support knowledge-discovery applications such as scientific exploration, reliance on highly structured ontologies as data-organization aids can be limiting. With current computational aids to science work, the human knowledge that creates meaning out of analyses is often only recorded when work reaches publication\u2014or worse, left unrecorded altogether\u2014for lack of an ontological model for scientific concepts that can capture knowledge as it is created and used. We argue for an approach to representing scientific concepts that reflects (1) the situated processes of science work, (2) the social construction of knowledge, and (3) the emergence and evolution of understanding over time. In this model, knowledge is the result of collaboration, negotiation, and manipulation by teams of researchers. Capturing the situations in which knowledge is created and used helps these collaborators discover areas of agreement and discord, while allowing individual inquirers to maintain different perspectives on the same information. The capture of provenance information allows historical trails of reasoning to be reconstructed, allowing end users to evaluate the utility and trustworthiness of knowledge representations. We present a proof-of-concept system, called Codex, based on this situated knowledge model. Codex supports visualization of knowledge structures through concept mapping, and enables inference across those structures. The proof-of-concept is deployed in the domain of geoscience to support distributed teams of learners and researchers.",

In a typical session with x2, the user first browses a structural summary of the XML database in order to select interesting elements and keywords occurring in documents. Using this intermediate result, queries combining structure and textual references are composed semiautomatically. After query evaluation, the full set of answers is presented in a visual and structured way. x2 largely exploits the structure found in documents, queries and answers to enable new interactive visualization and exploration techniques that support mixed IR and database-oriented querying, thus bridging the gap between these three views on the data to be retrieved. Another salient characteristic of x2 that distinguishes it from other visual query systems for XML is that it supports various degrees of detailedness in the presentation of answers, as well as techniques for dynamically reordering, grouping and ranking retrieved elements once the complete answer set has been computed.",

We suggest that icons in triage interfaces are better able to communicate information, provide feedback and enable faster user interactions than text, particularly in mobile-based interfaces. Through investigation of visualisation and perception processes, we are able to propose five primary icon categories, the two most dominant beingiconicandsymbolic: iconic representations mostly apply to graphically and spatially distinct document elements (i.e. Title, Abstract, Tables and Figures), externalising the elements\u2019 surface propositions. Symbolic representations are largely associated with elements of greater semantic value (Introduction, Conclusion, Full text and Author), drawing upon the elements\u2019 deep propositions.",

Materials and methods A total of 20 medical students reviewed quantitative test results from 4 patients using 4 different visualization techniques in a balanced, crossover experiment. The laboratory data represented relevant patient categories, including simple, emergency, chronic and complex patients. Participants answered questions about trend, overall levels and covariation of test results. Answers and assessment times were recorded and participants were interviewed on their preference of visualization technique. Results Assessment of results and the time used varied between visualization techniques. With sparklines and relative multigraphs participants made faster assessments. With relative multigraphs participants identified more covarying test results. With absolute multigraphs participants found more trends. With sparklines participants more often assessed laboratory results to be within reference ranges. Different visualization techniques were preferred for the four different patient categories. No participant preferred absolute multigraphs for any patient. Discussion Assessments of clinical chemistry test results were influenced by how they were presented. Importantly though, this association depended on the complexity of the result sets, and none of the visualization techniques appeared to be ideal in all settings. Conclusions Sparklines and relative multigraphs seem to be favorable techniques for presenting complex longterm clinical chemistry test results, while tables seem to suffice for simpler result sets.",

This article demonstrates the use of data analysis and visualization as a means to empower students, teachers, researchers, and platform developers by making large volumes of data easy to understand. First, we introduce the insight needs of different stakeholder groups. Second, we compare the wide variety of data provided by major MOOC platforms. Third, we present a novel framework that distinguishes visualizations by the type of questions they answer. We then review the state of the art MOOC visual analytics using a tabulation of stakeholder needs versus visual analytics workflow types. Finally, we present new data analysis and visualization workflows for statistical, geospatial, and topical insights. The workflows have been optimized and validated in the Information Visualization MOOC (IVMOOC) annually taught at Indiana University since 2013.

        "Abstract": "Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to propose an approach for conceptualizing science based on collaboration and competences of researchers. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The research is conducted by exploratory analysis of collaboration and competences using case studies from humanistic, engineering, natural sciences and a general topic. Findings \u2013 The findings show that by applying the proposed approach on bibliographic data that readily exist for many national sciences as well as for international scientific communities, one can obtain useful new insights into the research. The approach is demonstrated with the following exploratory findings: identification of important connections and individual researchers that connect the community of anthropologists; collaboration of technical scientists in the community of anthropologists caused by an interdisciplinary research project; connectivity, interdisciplinary and structure of artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and a community based on a general topic; and identifying research interest shift described with concretization and topic-shift. Practical implications \u2013 As demonstrated with the practical implementation (<ext-link>http://scienceatlas.ijs.si</ext-link>/), users can obtain information of the most relevant competences of a researcher and his most important collaborators. It is possible to obtaining researchers, community structure and competences of an arbitrary research topic. Social implications \u2013 The map for collaboration and competences of a complete science can be a crucial tool for policy-making. Social scientists can use the results of the proposed approach to better understand and direct the development of science. Originality/value \u2013 Originality and value of the paper is in combining text (competences) and network (research collaboration and co-authoring) approaches for exploring science. Additional values give the results of analysis that demonstrate the approach.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to retrieve relevant information is at the heart of every aspect of research and development in the life sciences industry. Information is often distributed across multiple systems and recorded in a way that makes it difficult to piece together the complete picture. Differences in data formats, naming schemes and network protocols amongst information sources, both public and private, must be overcome, and user interfaces not only need to be able to tap into these diverse information sources but must also assist users in filtering out extraneous information and highlighting the key relationships hidden within an aggregated set of information. The Semantic Web community has made great strides in proposing solutions to these problems, and many efforts are underway to apply Semantic Web techniques to the problem of information retrieval in the life sciences space. This article gives an overview of the principles underlying a Semantic Web-enabled information retrieval system: creating a unified abstraction for knowledge using the RDF semantic network model; designing semantic lenses that extract contextually relevant subsets of information; and assembling semantic lenses into powerful information displays. Furthermore, concrete examples of how these principles can be applied to life science problems including a scenario involving a drug discovery dashboard prototype called BioDash are provided.",

This approach is known to prompt reflection, facilitate planning and navigation. Open Learner Models may show different levels of detail of the underlying learner model, and may structure the information differently. However, a trade-off exists between useful information and the complexity of the information. This paper investigates whether offering richer information is assessed positively by learners and results in more effective support for learning tasks. An interview pre-study revealed which information within the complex learner model is of interest. A controlled user study examined six alternative visualisation prototypes of varying complexity and resulted in the implementation of one of the designs. A second controlled study involved students interacting with variations of the visualisation while searching for suitable learning material, and revealed the value of the design alternative and its variations. The work contributes to developing complex open learner models by stressing the need to balance complexity and support. It also suggests that the expressiveness of open learner models can be improved with visual elements that strategically summarise the complex information being displayed in detail.",

        "Abstract": "Objective - To identify research and publication trends related to health-seeking information behaviour on the Internet. Design - Bibliometric analysis, publication trends, and co-word biclustering analysis. Setting - Academic journals. Subjects - Journal articles retrieved from PubMed meeting eligibility criteria, and articles selected through hand-searching of the top three journals publishing in the identified area of research. Methods - A search for relevant articles was performed in PubMed and supplemented by manual searching of the top three journals in the field, yielding a total of 2,780 articles. Following a high concordance rate on screening agreement, researchers identified a total of 533 articles for inclusion. These articles were considered to be representative of all the articles published on Internet health-seeking behaviour as of September 2014. Data deemed essential to biclustering co-word analysis included article title, author, institution, country, source, publication year, and MeSH terms, and was collected in both XML and MEDLINE formats to ensure information exhaustivity for subsequent analysis. Analysis of the distribution of data, as well as major MeSH frequency ranking, allowed researchers to identify the most active journals in the subject area, while biclustering for highly frequent MeSH terms determined hot spots of research. Researchers used both mountain and matrix visualization to further illustrate semantic relationships of MeSH terms and the framework for the analysis of research hot spots. Co-word analysis facilitated the identification of like-articles based on major MeSH indexing, while cluster analysis utilized a matrix grouping to identify themes. By combining this information and reorganizing the matrix, researchers were able to highlight the most common themes. Main Results - Researchers identified ten research \"hot spots,\" the most prolific research topics, thus providing the top subject areas of research published in the literature related to Internet health-seeking behaviour. Top subjects include health information seeking behaviour related to HIV infection or sexually transmitted diseases; information seeking behaviour of students and of patients with cancer; consumer trust in online health information; behaviour of Internet health information seeking through mobile apps; the interaction between physician-patient relations/communications and Internet use; personal preference and computer literacy related to Internet use; and the use of social media by parents. In terms of publishing rates, the number of papers published on health information seeking behaviour has increased consistently since 1985, when only one paper was published, to 2013, in which 114 papers were published. Authors from 42 countries or regions contributed to the body of relevant literature, with authors from the United States of America accounting for over half of published papers. Just over 96% of articles were published in English. Of the 253 journals identified as publishers of these articles, eight published over one-third of all the identified articles. The Journal of Medical Internet Research published the most articles on this topic. Conclusion - Bibliographic analysis identified both subject and publication trends related to Internet health information seeking behaviour. Publication rates of research in the area of Internet health information have increased steadily since the first article was published in 1985. The bulk of the research tends to fall within ten identified hot spots, or research topics, according to a bibliometric analysis of indexing.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) face several challenges in accessing clinical tools to help them monitor, understand, and make meaningful decisions about their disease course. The University of California San Francisco MS BioScreen is a web-based precision medicine tool initially designed to be clinician facing. We aimed to design a second, openly available tool, Open MS BioScreen, that would be accessible, understandable, and actionable by people with MS.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aimed to describe the human-centered design and development approach (inspiration, ideation, and implementation) for creating the Open MS BioScreen platform.<bold>Methods: </bold>We planned an iterative and cyclical development process that included stakeholder engagement and iterative feedback from users. Stakeholders included patients with MS along with their caregivers and family members, MS experts, generalist clinicians, industry representatives, and advocacy experts. Users consisted of anyone who wants to track MS measurements over time and access openly available tools for people with MS. Phase I (inspiration) consisted of empathizing with users and defining the problem. We sought to understand the main challenges faced by patients and clinicians and what they would want to see in a web-based app. In phase II (ideation), our multidisciplinary team discussed approaches to capture, display, and make sense of user data. Then, we prototyped a series of mock-ups to solicit feedback from clinicians and people with MS. In phase III (implementation), we incorporated all concepts to test and iterate a minimally viable product. We then gathered feedback through an agile development process. The design and development were cyclical-many times throughout the process, we went back to the drawing board.<bold>Results: </bold>This human-centered approach generated an openly available, web-based app through which patients with MS, their clinicians, and their caregivers can access the site and create an account. Users can enter information about their MS (basic level as well as more advanced concepts), visualize their data longitudinally, access a series of algorithms designed to empower them to make decisions about their treatments, and enter data from wearable devices to encourage realistic goal setting about their ambulatory activity. Agile development will allow us to continue to incorporate precision medicine tools, as these are validated in the clinical research arena.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>After engaging intended users into the iterative human-centered design of the Open MS BioScreen, we will now monitor the adaptation and dissemination of the tool as we expand its functionality and reach. The insights generated from this approach can be applied to the development of a number of self-tracking, self-management, and user engagement tools for patients with chronic conditions.",

        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "This paper introduces the \"Personal Model for Research\" (PMR) version 2 as a framework and a tool to learn design of research proposals. It is better to say \"design\" instead of \"writing\" as usually referred in literature because \"writing\" cognitively induces to see the making of a research proposal as a linear sequence of steps, when in practice the articulation of its elements is a \"design\" activity: non-linear and iterative. Consequently, the Design Thinking approach is one core foundation of the PMR. Another core foundation is Personal Motivation because it is the driving force to move towards an end and, therefore, complete projects. Thus, to identify personal interests as sources for motivation to do a research is a key activity that must be made at the beginning. The application of the PMR is supported by the \"Canvas for Research\", a visualization method created to make visible its conceptual design and facilitate the articulation of elements for a research proposal before writing it as a document. As an ultimate purpose, the PMR aims to help students to think of research as an opportunity to demonstrate the best that they are able to do, thus contributing to knowledge and to humankind.",

Contact tracing is a vital strategy in epidemic emergency management; however, traditional contact tracing faces many limitations in practice. The application of digital technology provides an opportunity for local governments to trace the contacts of individuals with COVID-19 more comprehensively, efficiently, and precisely. Objective: Our research aimed to provide new solutions to overcome the limitations of traditional contact tracing by introducing the organizational process, technical process, and main achievements of digital contact tracing in Hainan Province. Methods: A graph database algorithm, which can efficiently process complex relational networks, was applied in Hainan Province; this algorithm relies on a governmental big data platform to analyze multisource COVID-19 epidemic data and build networks of relationships among high-risk infected individuals, the general population, vehicles, and public places to identify and trace contacts. We summarized the organizational and technical process of digital contact tracing in Hainan Province based on interviews and data analyses. Results: An integrated emergency management command system and a multi-agency coordination mechanism were formed during the emergency management of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hainan Province. The collection, storage, analysis, and application of multisource epidemic data were realized based on the government's big data platform using a centralized model. The graph database algorithm is compatible with this platform and can analyze multisource and heterogeneous big data related to the epidemic. These practices were used to quickly and accurately identify and trace 10,871 contacts among hundreds of thousands of epidemic data records; 378 closest contacts and a number of public places with high risk of infection were identified. A confirmed patient was found after quarantine measures were implemented by all contacts. Conclusions: During the emergency management of the COVID-19 epidemic, Hainan Province used a graph database algorithm to trace contacts in a centralized model, which can identify infected individuals and high-risk public places more quickly and accurately. This practice can provide support to government agencies to implement precise, agile, and evidence-based emergency management measures and improve the responsiveness of the public health emergency response system. Strengthening data security, improving tracing accuracy, enabling intelligent data collection, and improving data-sharing mechanisms and technologies are directions for optimizing digital contact tracing.

        "Title": "Interesting Patterns Found When Academic and Public Library Use by Foreign-born Students Is Assessed Using 'Super-Diversity' Variables.",
        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Objective - To evaluate the relationship between academic and public library usage and various characteristics of foreign-born students. Design - Survey questionnaire. Setting - Medium-sized public liberal arts college in the northeastern United States. Subjects - 123 foreign-born students enrolled at the institution in fall 2014. Methods - The researcher emailed a five-part survey to participants who indicated on a screening survey that they were foreign-born students currently enrolled at the college. Of the participants emailed, 94 completed the survey. The survey used a super-diversity lens to assess academic and public library use by foreign-born students in relationship to multiple variables, including student status, race and ethnicity, immigration status, firstgeneration student status, gender, age, age of arrival in the United States (US), years living in the US, and ZIP Code (used to approximate median income based on the US Census Bureau's 2014 American Community Survey). Respondents reported frequency of use on a Likert-type scale of 1=Never to 6=Always. The author adapted items from the In Library Use Survey Instrument (University of Washington Libraries, 2011). Usage types included: computer, Wi-Fi, staff assistance, electronic resources, physical resources, printing/scanning/photocopying, program attendance, and physical space. Independent sample t-tests were used to evaluate mean differences in reported library usage based on demographic variables. The author used Somers' d statistical tests to explore the relationship between library use and age, age on arrival in the US, years lived in the US, and median income. The survey asked participants to describe both academic and public libraries in five words. To show term frequency, the author used word clouds as a visualization technique. Main Results - The study reported on the results of the library use survey section. Overall, foreign-born students used college libraries more frequently than public libraries. The author reported on findings that were statistically significant (p = 0.5), focusing on those with mean differences = 0.5. Key findings included: undergraduate students used public libraries and Wi-Fi/e-resources onsite at college libraries more often than graduate students; first-generation students gathered at the library with friends more frequently; no significant difference was reported in library resource use by gender; and non-white students used the college library more frequently as a study space and for printing. The author was surprised no significant differences in usage were found between participants with permanent vs. temporary immigration status. Somers' d associations showed an inverse relationship between age and Wi-Fi use and age of arrival in the United States and likelihood of eating in the library. Overall, both library types were positively described in open-ended responses as places with social and academic value. Conclusion - The author suggested the concept of super-diversity equips librarians with a more inclusive approach to studying library user perspectives and behaviors. The author used survey data and the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Diversity Standards (2012) to highlight library service considerations for foreign-born students. Examples of suggested service improvements included supporting printing in Unicode non-English fonts, cultivating a diverse library staff, and providing culturally appropriate library orientations and outreach. The author recommended that more research with foreign-born students was needed to assess culturally appropriate areas for eating and socializing, unique information needs, and expectations and awareness of library services. The author suggested first-generation students' use of the library for socializing and non-white students' higher use of libraries for studying as two areas for further qualitative study. The author also suggested creating services and partnerships between public and academic libraries could support foreign-born students, even recommending cross-training of library staff.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Information disclosure is a top priority for official responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The timely and standardized information published by authorities as a response to the crisis can better inform the public and enable better preparations for the pandemic; however, there is limited evidence of any systematic analyses of the disclosed epidemic information. This in turn has important implications for risk communication.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aimed to describe and compare the officially released content regarding local epidemic situations as well as analyze the characteristics of information disclosure through local communication in major cities in China.<bold>Methods: </bold>The 31 capital cities in mainland China were included in this city-level observational study. Data were retrieved from local municipalities and health commission websites as of March 18, 2020. A checklist was employed as a rapid qualitative assessment tool to analyze the information disclosure performance of each city. Descriptive analyses and data visualizations were produced to present and compare the comparative performances of the cities.<bold>Results: </bold>In total, 29 of 31 cities (93.5%) established specific COVID-19 webpages to disclose information. Among them, 12 of the city webpages were added to their corresponding municipal websites. A majority of the cities (21/31, 67.7%) published their first cases of infection in a timely manner on the actual day of confirmation. Regarding the information disclosures highlighted on the websites, news updates from local media or press briefings were the most prevalent (28/29, 96.6%), followed by epidemic surveillance (25/29, 86.2%), and advice for the public (25/29, 86.2%). Clarifications of misinformation and frequently asked questions were largely overlooked as only 2 cities provided this valuable information. The median daily update frequency of epidemic surveillance summaries was 1.2 times per day (IQR 1.0-1.3 times), and the majority of these summaries (18/25, 72.0%) also provided detailed information regarding confirmed cases. The reporting of key indicators in the epidemic surveillance summaries, as well as critical facts included in the confirmed case reports, varied substantially between cities. In general, the best performance in terms of timely reporting and the transparency of information disclosures were observed in the municipalities directly administered by the central government compared to the other cities.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Timely and effective efforts to disclose information related to the COVID-19 epidemic have been made in major cities in China. Continued improvements to local authority reporting will contribute to more effective public communication and efficient public health research responses. The development of protocols and the standardization of epidemic message templates-as well as the use of uniform operating procedures to provide regular information updates-should be prioritized to ensure a coordinated national response.",

        "Abstract": "We present an analytic and a large scale experimental comparison of two informationally equivalent information displays of soccer statistics. Both displays were presented by the BBC during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The displays mainly differ in terms of the number and types of cognitively natural mappings between visual variables and meaning. Theoretically, such natural formmeaning mappings help users to interpret the information quickly and easily. However, our analysis indicates that the design which contains most of these mappings is inevitably inconsistent in how forms and meanings are mapped to each other. The experiment shows that this inconsistency was detrimental for how fast people can find information in the display and for which display people prefer to use. Our findings shed new light on the well-established cognitive design principle of natural mapping: while in theory, information designs may benefit from natural mapping, in practice its applicability may be limited. Information designs that contain a high number of form-meaning mappings, for example, for aesthetic reasons, risk being inconsistent and too complex for users, leading them to find information less quickly and less easily.",

        "Abstract": "As digital platforms are transforming almost every industry today, they are slowly finding their way into the mainstream information systems (ISs) literature. Digital platforms are a challenging research object because of their distributed nature and intertwinement with institutions, markets and technologies. New research challenges arise as a result of the exponentially growing scale of platform innovation, the increasing complexity of platform architectures and the spread of digital platforms to many different industries. This paper develops a research agenda for digital platforms research in IS. We recommend researchers seek to (1) advance conceptual clarity by providing clear definitions that specify the unit of analysis, degree of digitality and the sociotechnical nature of digital platforms; (2) define the proper scoping of digital platform concepts by studying platforms on different architectural levels and in different industry settings; and (3) advance methodological rigour by employing embedded case studies, longitudinal studies, design research, data-driven modelling and visualisation techniques. Considering current developments in the business domain, we suggest six questions for further research: (1) Are platforms here to stay? (2) How should platforms be designed? (3) How do digital platforms transform industries? (4) How can data-driven approaches inform digital platforms research? (5) How should researchers develop theory for digital platforms? and (6) How do digital platforms affect everyday life?",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Falls are a common health problem, which in the worst cases can lead to death. To develop reliable fall detection algorithms as well as suitable prevention interventions, it is important to understand circumstances and characteristics of real-world fall events. Although falls are common, they are seldom observed, and reports are often biased. Wearable inertial sensors provide an objective approach to capture real-world fall signals. However, it is difficult to directly derive visualization and interpretation of body movements from the fall signals, and corresponding video data is rarely available.<bold>Objective: </bold>The re-enactment method uses available information from inertial sensors to simulate fall events, replicate the data, validate the simulation, and thereby enable a more precise description of the fall event. The aim of this paper is to describe this method and demonstrate the validity of the re-enactment approach.<bold>Methods: </bold>Real-world fall data, measured by inertial sensors attached to the lower back, were selected from the Fall Repository for the Design of Smart and Self-Adaptive Environments Prolonging Independent Living (FARSEEING) database. We focused on well-described fall events such as stumbling to be re-enacted under safe conditions in a laboratory setting. For the purposes of exemplification, we selected the acceleration signal of one fall event to establish a detailed simulation protocol based on identified postures and trunk movement sequences. The subsequent re-enactment experiments were recorded with comparable inertial sensor configurations as well as synchronized video cameras to analyze the movement behavior in detail. The re-enacted sensor signals were then compared with the real-world signals to adapt the protocol and repeat the re-enactment method if necessary. The similarity between the simulated and the real-world fall signals was analyzed with a dynamic time warping algorithm, which enables the comparison of two temporal sequences varying in speed and timing.<bold>Results: </bold>A fall example from the FARSEEING database was used to show the feasibility of producing a similar sensor signal with the re-enactment method. Although fall events were heterogeneous concerning chronological sequence and curve progression, it was possible to reproduce a good approximation of the motion of a person's center of mass during fall events based on the available sensor information.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Re-enactment is a promising method to understand and visualize the biomechanics of inertial sensor-recorded real-world falls when performed in a suitable setup, especially if video data is not available.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to present an overview of the challenges encountered in integrating visual search interfaces into digital libraries and repositories. These challenges come in various forms, including information visualisation, the use of knowledge organisation systems and metadata quality. The main purpose of this study is the identification of criteria for the evaluation and integration of visual search interfaces, proposing guidelines and recommendations to improve information retrieval tasks with emphasis on the education-al context.Design/methodology/approach The information included in this study was collected based on a systematic literature review approach. The main information sources were explored in several digital libraries, including Science Direct, Scopus, ACM and IEEE, and include journal articles, conference proceedings, books, European project reports and deliverables and PhD theses published in an electronic format. A total of 142 studies comprised the review.Findings There are several issues that authors did not fully discuss in this literature review study; more specific, aspects associated with access of digital resources in digital libraries and repositories based on human computer interaction, i.e. usability and learnability of user interfaces; design of a suitable navigation method of search based on simple knowledge organisation schemes; and the use of usefulness of visual search interfaces to locate relevant resources.Research limitations/implications The main steps for carrying out a systematic review are drawn from health care; this methodology is not commonly used in fields such as digital libraries and repositories. The authors aimed to apply the fundamentals of the systematic literature review methodology considering the context of this study. Additionally, there are several aspects of accessibility that were not considered in the study, such as accessibility to content for disabled people as defined by ISO/IEC 40500:2012.Originality/value No other systematic literature reviews have been conducted in this field. The research presents an in-depth analysis of the criteria associated with searching and navigation methods based on the systematic literature review approach. The analysis is relevant for researchers in the field of digital library and repository creation in that it may direct them to considerations in designing and implementing visual search interfaces based on the use of information visualisation.",

        "Abstract": "Scientific communities are under increasing pressure from funding organizations to publish their raw data, in addition to their traditional publications, in open archives. Many scientists would be willing to do this if they had tools that streamlined the process and exposed simple provenance information, i.e., enough to explain the methodology and validate the results without compromising the author\u2019s intellectual property or competitive advantage. This paper presents Provenance Explorer, a tool that enables the provenance trail associated with a scientific discovery process to be visualized and explored through a graphical user interface (GUI). Based on RDF graphs, it displays the sequence of data, states and events associated with a scientific workflow, illustrating the methodology that led to the published results. The GUI also allows permitted users to expand selected links between nodes to reveal more fine-grained information and sub-workflows. But more importantly, the system enables scientists to selectively construct \u201cscientific publication packages\u201d by choosing particular nodes from the visual provenance trail and dragging-and-dropping them into an RDF package which can be uploaded to an archive or repository for publication or e-learning. The provenance relationships between the individual components in the package are automatically inferred using a rules-based inferencing engine.",

These advantages include: semantic browsing and visualization of learning object contents, advanced search capabilities linking to several different online collections, easy extension of learning objects with external content added by learners and educators, and utilization of the many rich models of education and educational domains now available as ontologies. As well as conceptual justifications and descriptions of our work, we provide examples throughout to concretize the ideas presented, using learning objects developed for college-level education in geography and the geosciences. We conclude with some thoughts on the further possibilities that arise from the application of detailed semantics, and associated reasoning, in the pursuit of genuinely reusable educational content that integrates more closely with community research activities such as exemplified by e-science.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose - This paper aims to present the schematic for building a multimedia information visualization system and digital archive which takes advantage of a wider spectrum of media elements (images, sound, datasets) and interactivity with regards to research level historical body of knowledge. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology for this interactive multimedia visualized system was based on create a digital environment to explore larger bodies of research that expand on simple text-based Information Retrieval Database systems. Through photos, videos, interactive maps, digital audio interviews, primary documents and narrative structures the system presents new methodologies for building digital libraries. The \u2018educational\u2019 objective of this project was to present a stylistically elegant yet intellectually robust interactive multimedia information system for academic libraries. Findings - Building new online digital libraries must involve robust interactivity to take advantage of the computer's intrinsic specificity and the wider set of choices open to the human perceptual apparatus. Instead of text-based navigation systems, a more creative set of visual \u2018tools\u2019 should be explored for digital libraries including interactivity and cognitive cartographies. Key here are the terms \u2018visual metaphor\u2019 and innovatively structuring visually intuitive \u2018narratives\u2019 into non-linear dynamic but humanly usable information systems. Research limitations/implications - In expanding the range of \u2018allowable\u2019 \u2018historical archival media\u2019 (audio, video, images, datasets, databases) in digital libraries and keeping research level academic integrity, future questions regard what this means for historiography, information construction, and questions surrounding epistemology and \u2018archives\u2019 of the future. Practical implications - Technically, the successes in building this digital library information system solve the question of how to present a large robust amount of information indifferent rich media formats in an interesting and engaging manner. The project points to methodologies to present a research spectrum depth structure of textual material that can seamlessly be incorporated through wider spectrum of media elements: images, video, audio, music, datasets and interactivity. Originality/value - This paper provides a methodology for manying a textual body of academic research with a wider spectrum of media elements (sound, images, datasets, music) and incorporating them into a digital library through an innovative methodology. It will be valuable to anyone needing guidelines and specific algorithmic recipes and suggestions for building new millennia digital libraries which take advantage of a wider spectrum of media elements.",

        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Background: The retina is a multi-layered sensory tissue that lines the back of the eye and acts at the interface of input light and visual perception. Its main function is to capture photons and convert them into electrical impulses that travel along the optic nerve to the brain where they are turned into images. It consists of neurons, nourishing blood vessels and different cell types, of which neural cells predominate. Defects in any of these cells can lead to a variety of retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis and glaucoma. Recent progress in genomics and microarray technology provides extensive opportunities to examine alterations in retinal gene expression profiles during development and diseases. However, there is no specific database that deals with retinal gene expression profiling. In this context we have built RETINOBASE, a dedicated microarray database for retina. Description: RETINOBASE is a microarray relational database, analysis and visualization system that allows simple yet powerful queries to retrieve information about gene expression in retina. It provides access to gene expression metadata and offers significant insights into gene networks in retina, resulting in better hypothesis framing for biological problems that can subsequently be tested in the laboratory. Public and proprietary data are automatically analyzed with 3 distinct methods, RMA, dChip and MAS5, then clustered using 2 different K-means and 1 mixture models method. Thus, RETINOBASE provides a framework to compare these methods and to optimize the retinal data analysis. RETINOBASE has three different modules, \"Gene Information\", \"Raw Data System Analysis\" and \"Fold change system Analysis\" that are interconnected in a relational schema, allowing efficient retrieval and cross comparison of data. Currently, RETINOBASE contains datasets from 28 different microarray experiments performed in 5 different model systems: drosophila, zebrafish, rat, mouse and human. The database is supported by a platform that is designed to easily integrate new functionalities and is also frequently updated. Conclusion: The results obtained from various biological scenarios can be visualized, compared and downloaded. The results of a case study are presented that highlight the utility of RETINOBASE. Overall, RETINOBASE provides efficient access to the global expression profiling of retinal genes from different organisms under various conditions.",

This model is then used to understand the findings from a phenomenology-of-practice study of the work of seven visual artists as they each created a self-portrait, understood here as a form of documentation.Findings A number of themes are found to express the first-person experience of art-making in these examples, including communicating, memories, reference materials, taking breaks and stepping back. The themes are discussed with an eye toward articulating what is shared and unique in these experiences. Finally, the themes are mapped successfully to the theoretical model.Research limitations/implications The study involved artists creating self-portraits, and further research will be required to determine if the thematic findings are unique to self-portraiture or apply as well to art-making, to documentation generally, etc. Still, the theoretical model developed here seems useful for analyzing documentation experiences.Practical implications As many activities and tasks in contemporary life can be conceptualized as documentation, this model provides a valuable analytical tool for better understanding those experiences. This can ground education and management decisions for those involved.Originality/value This paper makes conceptual and empirical contributions to document theory and the study of the information behavior of artists, particularly furthering discussions of information and document experience.",

        "Abstract": "Background: The Portable Document Format (PDF) is the standard file format for the communication of biomedical information via the internet and for electronic scholarly publishing. Although PDF allows for the embedding of three-dimensional (3D) objects and although this technology has great potential for the communication of such data, it is not broadly used by the scientific community or by clinicians. Objective: The objective of this review was to provide an overview of existing publications that apply 3D PDF technology and the protocols and tools for the creation of model files and 3D PDFs for scholarly purposes to demonstrate the possibilities and the ways to use this technology. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. Articles searched for were in English, peer-reviewed with biomedical reference, published since 2005 in a journal or presented at a conference or scientific meeting. Ineligible articles were removed after screening. The found literature was categorized into articles that (1) applied 3D PDF for visualization, (2) showed ways to use 3D PDF, and (3) provided tools or protocols for the creation of 3D PDFs or necessary models. Finally, the latter category was analyzed in detail to provide an overview of the state of the art. Results: The search retrieved a total of 902 items. Screening identified 200 in-scope publications, 13 covering the use of 3D PDF for medical purposes. Only one article described a clinical routine use case; all others were pure research articles. The disciplines that were covered beside medicine were many. In most cases, either animal or human anatomies were visualized. A method, protocol, software, library, or other tool for the creation of 3D PDFs or model files was described in 19 articles. Most of these tools required advanced programming skills and/or the installation of further software packages. Only one software application presented an all-in-one solution with a graphical user interface. Conclusions: The use of 3D PDF for visualization purposes in clinical communication and in biomedical publications is still not in common use, although both the necessary technique and suitable tools are available, and there are many arguments in favor of this technique. The potential of 3D PDF usage should be disseminated in the clinical and biomedical community. Furthermore, easy-to-use, standalone, and free-of-charge software tools for the creation of 3D PDFs should be developed.",

        "Abstract": "Media bias describes differences in the content or presentation of news. It is an ubiquitous phenomenon in news coverage that can have severely negative effects on individuals and society. Identifying media bias is a challenging problem, for which current information systems offer little support. News aggregators are the most important class of systems to support users in coping with the large amount of news that is published nowadays. These systems focus on identifying and presenting important, common information in news articles, but do not reveal different perspectives on the same topic. Due to this analysis approach, current news aggregators cannot effectively reveal media bias. To address this problem, we present matrix-based news aggregation, a novel approach for news exploration that helps users gain a broad and diverse news understanding by presenting various perspectives on the same news topic. Additionally, we present NewsBird, an open-source news aggregator that implements matrix-based news aggregation for international news topics. The results of a user study showed that NewsBird more effectively broadens the user's news understanding than the list-based visualization approach employed by established news aggregators, while achieving comparable effectiveness and efficiency for the two main use cases of news consumption: getting an overview of and finding details on current news topics.",

        "Abstract": "The increase in the number of dimensions of cancerous gene expression dataset causes an increase in complexity, misinterpretation and decrease in the visualisation of the particular dataset for further analysis. Therefore, dimensionality reduction, visualisation and modelling tasks of these dataset become challenging. In this paper, a framework is developed which helps to understand, visualise and model high-dimensional cancerous gene expression dataset into lower dimensions which may be helpful in revealing cancer mechanism and diagnosis. Initially, cancerous gene expression datasets are preprocessed to make them complete, precise and efficient; and principal component analysis is applied for dimensionality reduction and visualisation purpose. The regression is used to model the cancerous gene expression dataset so that type of association (linear or nonlinear) and directions between gene profiles may be estimated. To assess the performance of the developed framework, three different types of cancerous gene expression datasets are taken namely: breast (GEO Acc. No. GDS5076), lung (GEO Acc. No. GDS5040) and prostate (GEO Acc. No. GDS5072) which are publicly available. To validate the results of the regression the cross-validation method is used. The results revealed that a linear approach is to be used for prostate cancer dataset and nonlinear approach for breast and lung cancer datasets in finding an association between gene pairs.",

Visualization technique is considered to be most eloquent and illustrative way of representing patent information and its analysis results to get insight into various aspects of any particular technology. Statistical analysis of the relevant patent dataset is carried out using patent maps in the visualisation techniques. Different patent maps help in understanding various aspects about the searched system/ technology like top patent assignees, top Inventors. Time based analysis provides the trends of technology on the time scale, while cross-mapping of the patent documents provides further useful information. All the above analysis can be illustrated in patent maps to make it more presentable, structured and customised.

Despite this, relatively little work has been done to visualize knowledge organization systems, such as controlled vocabularies or thesauri. In this paper we explore the creation and use of contextual visualizations based on thesauri. Two different methods are developed for creating maps of thesaurus terms that can then be used as templates or basemaps on which to display the contents of publication sets. The first example maps first-level terms from the Unified Astronomy Thesaurus into a wheel-like (hub and spokes) configuration. This circular map can then be used to show relative positions of clusters of astronomy papers from different cluster solutions based on the thesaurus terms assigned to the papers in the clusters. The second example triangulates the entire Public Library of Science (PLOS) thesaurus onto a global map of science, and then uses the resulting map of thesaurus terms as the basis for an overlay map. This map can be used for several purposes, including mapping of subsets of PLOS content, and the identification of thesaurus terms whose rule bases may need to be changed.",

        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Background: Structural and functional brain images are essential imaging modalities for medical experts to study brain anatomy. These images are typically visually inspected by experts. To analyze images without any bias, they must be first converted to numeric values. Many software packages are available to process the images, but they are complex and difficult to use. The software packages are also hardware intensive. The results obtained after processing vary depending on the native operating system used and its associated software libraries; data processed in one system cannot typically be combined with data on another system. Objective: The aim of this study was to fulfill the neuroimaging community's need for a common platform to store, process, explore, and visualize their neuroimaging data and results using Neuroimaging Web Services Interface: a series of processing pipelines designed as a cyber physical system for neuroimaging and clinical data in brain research. Methods: Neuroimaging Web Services Interface accepts magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. These images are processed using existing and custom software packages. The output is then stored as image files, tabulated files, and MySQL tables. The system, made up of a series of interconnected servers, is password-protected and is securely accessible through a Web interface and allows (1) visualization of results and (2) downloading of tabulated data. Results: All results were obtained using our processing servers in order to maintain data validity and consistency. The design is responsive and scalable. The processing pipeline started from a FreeSurfer reconstruction of Structural magnetic resonance imaging images. The FreeSurfer and regional standardized uptake value ratio calculations were validated using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative input images, and the results were posted at the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging data archive. Notable leading researchers in the field of Alzheimer's Disease and epilepsy have used the interface to access and process the data and visualize the results. Tabulated results with unique visualization mechanisms help guide more informed diagnosis and expert rating, providing a truly unique multimodal imaging platform that combines magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. A quality control component was reinforced through expert visual rating involving at least 2 experts. Conclusions: To our knowledge, there is no validated Web-based system offering all the services that Neuroimaging Web Services Interface offers. The intent of Neuroimaging Web Services Interface is to create a tool for clinicians and researchers with keen interest on multimodal neuroimaging. More importantly, Neuroimaging Web Services Interface significantly augments the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data, especially since our data contain a large cohort of Hispanic normal controls and Alzheimer's Disease patients. The obtained results could be scrutinized visually or through the tabulated forms, informing researchers on subtle changes that characterize the different stages of the disease.",

The distinctiveness of prior art patent citations compared to bibliographic references in the nonpatent literature is discussed. Starting from these observations and using the patent classification scheme as a framework of reference, we have identified a data structure, the \u201ctechnology footprint,\u201d derived from the patents cited as prior art for a selected set of patents. This data structure will provide us with dynamic information about the technological components of the selected set of patents, which represents a technology, company, or inventor. Two case studies are presented in order to illustrate the visualization of the technology footprint: one concerning an inventor\u2014Mr. Engelbart, the inventor of the \u201ccomputer mouse\u201d\u2014and another concerning the early years of a technology\u2014computerized tomography.",

        "Abstract": "Real data often contain anomalous cases, also known as outliers. These may spoil the resulting analysis but they may also contain valuable information. In either case, the ability to detect such anomalies is essential. A useful tool for this purpose is robust statistics, which aims to detect the outliers by first fitting the majority of the data and then flagging data points that deviate from it. We present an overview of several robust methods and the resulting graphical outlier detection tools. We discuss robust procedures for univariate, low\u2010dimensional, and high\u2010dimensional data, such as estimating location and scatter, linear regression, principal component analysis, classification, clustering, and functional data analysis. Also the challenging new topic of cellwise outliers is introduced. <italic>WIREs Data Mining Knowl Discov</italic> 2018, 8:e1236. doi: 10.1002/widm.1236 This article is categorized under:  Algorithmic Development > Spatial and Temporal Data Mining  Technologies > Classification  Technologies > Structure Discovery and Clustering  Technologies > Visualization",

        "Abstract": "In interactive visual data exploration, users rely on recommendations on what data to explore next. EVLIN is a system that recommends queries to retrieve these data for the next exploration step, paired with suited visualizations. This paper extends EVLIN by combining its content-based recommendations with recommendations leveraging collaborative filtering to improve the effectiveness of recommendation-based visual data exploration. The recommendations rely on evolution provenance, which tracks users' interactions during interactive visual data exploration. As more users explore a dataset, the evolution provenance of individual user explorations is incrementally integrated into a multi-user graph, for which we present match and merge algorithms. To compute collaborative-filtering recommendations, we present a search algorithm and optimizations to efficiently search queries similar to a current user's query in the multi-user graph and give preference to queries that have been previously explored in an exploration step succeeding those similar queries. Our experimental evaluation studies the efficiency and effectiveness of the solutions proposed in this paper and demonstrates that using the full system with both content-based and collaborative-filtering recommendations enabled allows for effective interactive visual data exploration. \u2022 Proposal of a visual data exploration system with content and collaborative recommendations. \u2022 Proposal of several merge techniques to aggregate users exploration sessions in a multi-user graph. \u2022 Proposal of several optimizations to improve collaborative-filtering recommendation computation. \u2022 Quantitative evaluation of collaborative-filtering recommendations techniques. \u2022 Qualitative evaluation of users experiences when visually exploring data using our system.",

Access to comprehensive information and the automated features/systematized processes were the primary accessibility and usability facilitator themes. The need for training, time to complete the tool, and computer-centric care were identified as possible usability barriers. Patient accountability, reminders for best practice, goal-focused care, and communication/counseling themes indicate that the STOP Stroke Tool supports the paradigm of patient-centered care.

        "Abstract": "Since the adoption of faceted search in a small number of academic libraries in 2006, faceted search interfaces have gained popularity in academic and public libraries. This article clarifies whether faceted search improves the interactions between searchers and library catalogs and sheds light on ways that facets are used during a library search. To study searchers' behaviors in natural situations, we collected from the servers a data set with more than 1.5 million useful search logs. Logs were parsed, statistically analyzed, and manually studied using visualization tools to gain a general understanding of how facets are used in the search process. A user experiment with 24 subjects was conducted to further understand contextual information, such as the searchers' motivations and perceptions. The results indicate that most searchers were able to understand the concept of facets naturally and easily. The faceted search was not able to shorten the search time but was able to improve the search accuracy. Facets were used more for open-ended tasks and difficult tasks that require more effort to learn, investigate, and explore. Overall, the results weaved a detailed 'story' about the ways that people use facets and the ways that facets help people use library catalogs.",

The study used 25 academic users carrying out three search tasks on both user interfaces. It applied usability and affordance strength questionnaires, interviews, think-alouds, and direct observation to investigate users' evaluation of the key components of both user interfaces--namely, multilingual features, thesaurus and search functions, and visualization and visual appeal. Results of the study show that users were able to successfully carry out the search tasks using thesaurus-enhanced search interfaces. However, they preferred Searchling, a faceted search user interface, for its flexible language option, thesaurus browsing, and visualization. Users preferred the interface to show the thesaural relationships along with the selected term without interacting with the interface. The empirical data gathered and the design ideas implemented within the two user interfaces will be useful for designers of search interfaces that make use of thesaurus and multilingual features. The design and methodological framework of the developed user interfaces and the study could be used to create more information-rich multilingual academic search user interfaces for teaching and learning purposes. The design and representation of thesaural terms and structures in these two interfaces are designed using novel visualization techniques.",

        "Abstract": "Information system (IS) procurement in the public sector is a strictly legislated process where different worries and concerns emerge already in its early phases. They may later lead to hazardous and unwanted outcomes when procuring, acquiring, or implementing the IS. To reduce unsatisfactory outcomes and fears and improve public IS procurement, we thus need to understand different concerns and their effects. In this paper, we present a qualitative single case study where different concerns emerge in the market consultation documentation of a public IS procurement. We identify and analyze the concerns by using the grounded theory approach. We then reflect them with the public IS procurement challenges and the European Union (EU) procurement legislation to understand their influence in public procurement. This provides twofold outcomes: a list of concerns and a model that illustrates their interrelations and a long impact chain within the procurement documentations. The model underlines the impacts of different concerns on IS procurement in general, and on system requirements and vendor selection in particular. Especially the role of requirement specifications is emphasized as it largely defines the vendor selection and the contract.

Network graphs and geographical maps were built from the search engine data. Social network analysis techniques were used to analyse and describe the structural properties of the whole of the network and its nodes. The results show that the world-class university network is constituted from national sub-networks that merge in a central core where the principal universities of each country pull their networks toward international link relationships. The United States dominates the world network, and within Europe the British and the German sub-networks stand out.",

It enables informed decisions to be made by individuals, as well as guides the creation of public policies. As with many domains, information on public safety is usually spread across different organizations, described in different formats and published at different levels of granularity and richness. In this paper, we present work done on a web-based portal that aggregates and displays public safety information for the city of Troy, New York. This portal shows how the use of semantic technologies facilitates the integration of multiple data sources with disparate characteristics. The portal demonstrates two types of functionality: First, it shows different examples of integration of public safety information through a variety of examples and visualizations. Second, it acts as a source of semantified data that third-party developers can use in their own applications.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: There are many medical image processing software tools available for research and diagnosis purposes. However, most of these tools are available only as local applications. This limits the accessibility of the software to a specific machine, and thus the data and processing power of that application are not available to other workstations. Further, there are operating system and processing power limitations which prevent such applications from running on every type of workstation. By developing web-based tools, it is possible for users to access the medical image processing functionalities wherever the internet is available. In this paper, we introduce a pure web-based, interactive, extendable, 2D and 3D medical image processing and visualization application that requires no client installation. Our software uses a four-layered design consisting of an algorithm layer, web-user-interface layer, server communication layer, and wrapper layer. To compete with extendibility of the current local medical image processing software, each layer is highly independent of other layers. A wide range of medical image preprocessing, registration, and segmentation methods are implemented using open source libraries. Desktop-like user interaction is provided by using AJAX technology in the web-user-interface. For the visualization functionality of the software, the VRML standard is used to provide 3D features over the web. Integration of these technologies has allowed implementation of our purely web-based software with high functionality without requiring powerful computational resources in the client side. The user-interface is designed such that the users can select appropriate parameters for practical research and clinical studies.",

Next-generation OPACs ignore the rich network of relations offered by controlled subject vocabulary, which can facilitate subject browsing. A new generation of OPACs could leverage existing information-organization investments and offer online searchers a novel browsing and searching environment. This is a case study of the design and development of a virtual reality subject browsing and information retrieval tool. The functional prototype shows that the Library of Congress subject headings (LCSH) can be shaped into a useful and usable tree structure serving as a visual metaphor that contains a real world collection from the domain of science and engineering. Formative tests show that users can effectively browse the LCSH tree and carve it up based on their keyword search queries. This study uses a complex information-organization structure as a defining characteristic of an OPAC that goes beyond the standard keyword search model, toward the cutting edge of online search tools.",

        "Abstract": "The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) is one of the largest research and higher education organisations in the world focusing on engineering and natural sciences. At present KIT, under the chairmanship of its executive board, is installing an extensive current research information system (CRIS) covering all institutes and facilities of the organisation. The assumption underlying the project is that a consistent overview of research performance has become fundamental for the international competitiveness of research institutions and is increasingly important for strategic decisions at the executive level. Ultimately, it also leads to better data and control in rankings at higher education assessments. The new research information system systematically maps all of KIT\u2019s processes and instruments to obtain, connect, present and utilise the research metadata of active researchers. This reduces the documentation workload for researchers, for the executive level and central units such as the library, and at the same time allows for and facilitates an overall view and the aggregation and visualisation of research metadata. Our vision is to build a federally structured network of systems that gathers information on KIT\u2019s publications, research competence, research projects, patents and technological offers by retrieving data from external and internal sources as well as directly from the researchers. The network facilitates linking and aggregating of data and provides unique identifiers for individual researchers and organizational units. With its consistent data model the research information system also fosters the organisational development of KIT, which was formed in 2009 by the merger of a university and a national research centre. The researchers and their activities are at the core of the research information system. The system substantially reduces their administrative burden in documenting project information and publications. Automatic data import from external online sources and repositories has the big advantage that publication data are acquired and validated only once and can be used subsequently for manifold purposes such as websites, CVs, publication lists and reference management software. Due to the complexity of workflows, internal and external sources and the organisational infrastructure that is required for such an implementation, KIT has chosen a commercial software solution (by AVEDAS AG) as the basic installation, and in cooperation with AVEDAS will expand it and adjust it to a tailor-made system that covers the entire KIT publication and research life cycle. The CRIS at KIT is part of a larger integrated and service-oriented approach to information management (Karlsruhe Integrated Information Management \u2014 KIM).",

        "Abstract": "Strategies employing information science and scientometric approaches were introduced to science policy and management over the past decades. As a rapidly evolving field, new bibliometric parameters are proposed and discussed continuously and the fields also benefits from the introduction of novel visualization techniques. The present article summarizes the experiences with a platform that combines geographical mapping with scientometrics. It was established between 2005 and 2008 at the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin and termed \"New Quality and Quantity Indices in Science\" (NewQIS), consisting of the integration of common scientometric parameters such as the h-index and novel visualization techniques including density equalizing mapping. NewQIS was used to assess socio-economic important fields of medicine and sciences. Within NewQIS studies, research activities, citation patterns and their relation to socio-economic figures were analyzed with regard to time periods, countries, continents or even single cities. Within the decade after its establishment, more than 80 NewQIS articles were peer-reviewed and published. Being a non-funded low budget project, it was used by many medical students to conduct their MD thesis. The narrow technical frame led to the chance of a comparison of research output between different fields of science. This article summarizes NewQIS 1.0 activities, discusses its limits and gives a look into the future of NewQIS 2.0 with a target of 200 evaluated entities of the biomedical field of sciences.",

Design/methodology/approach -- This study collected literature published during 1900-2012 from the Web of Science database. The bibliometric analysis was performed from authorial, institutional, national, spatiotemporal, and topical aspects. Basic statistical analysis, visualization of geographic distribution, co-word analysis, and a new index were applied to the selected data. Findings -- Characteristics of publication outputs suggested that ontology research has entered into the soaring stage, along with increased participation and collaboration. The authors identified the leading authors, institutions, nations, and articles in ontology research. Authors were more from North America, Europe, and East Asia. The USA took the lead, while China grew fastest. Four major categories of frequently used keywords were identified: applications in Semantic Web, applications in bioinformatics, philosophy theories, and common supporting technology. Semantic Web research played a core role, and gene ontology study was well-developed. The study focus of ontology has shifted from philosophy to information science. Originality/value -- This is the first study to quantify global research patterns and trends in ontology, which might provide a potential guide for the future research. The new index provides an alternative way to evaluate the multidisciplinary influence of researchers.",

It is therefore important to contribute to the long-term viability of longer documents by providing better support for selective reading. Readers may be more willing to read longer documents knowing they have ample and near-seamless choices regarding which topics they can read and the level of detail at which they can read a particular topic. To design for selective reading requires an understanding of how readers deal with incomplete information and the concepts of prerequisite information and dependency relationships. Three broad approaches can be identified: building supported reading pathways, modularization, and summarization.",

Graph-analysis techniques are developed to find suspicious individuals, suspicious relationships between individuals, unusual changes over time, unusual geospatial dispersion, and anomalous network structure. The visualization interface, known as the network explorer, provides a good overview of data and enables users to filter, select, and zoom into network details on demand.

Two controlled experiments were conducted to test hypotheses regarding subjects\u2019 efficiency in visually identifying the shortest distance among a set of market locations in a map. As a general result, we found that participants were able to correctly identify shortest distances when the difference to potential alternatives was sufficiently large, but performance decreased systematically when this difference decreased. Noticeable differences emerged for the investigated visualisation conditions. Participants in this study were equally efficient when using aweak 3Drepresentation and a 2D representation. When thestrong 3Dvisualisation was employed, they reported visual discomfort and tasks solved were significantly less correct. Presentations of intrinsic 2D content (maps) in 3D context did not, in this study, benefit from cues provided by astrong 3Dvisualisation and are adequately implemented using aweak 3Dvisualisation.",

        "Abstract": "A pie chart is a common way of presenting simple statistics-for example, the amount of time devoted to teaching, researching, and administration by the faculty can be illustrated by dividing a circle ('pie') into three appropriately sized segments. There has been much discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of such pie charts for a long time, and it is not likely to end soon. 3D pie charts show the same statistics, but in three dimensions. Multiple pie charts can be found where the data for groups to be compared are presented in adjacent pies. Here we argue that, even if a simple pie chart may have some advantages, the same cannot be said for multiple pie charts. Multiple pie charts are difficult to analyze and interpret, especially when comparing adjacent pies.",

Visualization tools have emerged in research environments and more recently on the Web to retrieve information. Questions arise in regard to the utility of Web-based IR visualization tools for assisting users not only in manipulating search output, but also in managing the information retrieval process. To understand how Web-based visualization tools enable visual information retrieval, this article reviews some of the human perceptual theory behind the graphical interface of information visualization systems, analyzes iconic representations and information density on visualization displays, and examines information retrieval tasks that have been used in visualization system user research. This article is timely since it addresses new technologies for Web information retrieval and discusses future information visualization user research directions.",

        "Abstract": "Increasing availability of digital libraries of K-12 educational resources, coupled with an increased emphasis on standard-based teaching necessitates assignment of the standards to those resources. Since manual assignment is a laborious and ongoing task, machine-based standard assignment tools have been under development for some time. Unfortunately, data on the performance of these machine-based classifiers are mostly lacking. In this article, we explore network modeling and layout to gain insight into the differences between assignments made by catalogers and those by the well-known Content Assignment Tool (CAT) machine-based classifier. To build the standard assignment networks, we define standards to be linked if they are jointly assigned to a learning resource. Comparative analysis of the topology and layout of the networks shows that whereas the cataloger-based network reflects the underlying curriculum, i.e., clusters of standards separate along lines of lesson content and pedagogical principles, the machine-based network lacks these relationships. This shortcoming is partially traced back to the machine classifier's difficulties in recognizing standards that express ways and means of conducting science.",

News items were designed to be short and concise, with hyperlinks citing sources. Readers could either ignore hyperlinks or explore additional information from the hyperlinked sources. We expected that appreciation for these news stories would be moderated by personal characteristics, namely hypertext comfort and desirability of control. In a 2 (hyperlink presence) \u00d7 2 (directness of speech) experiment, two news stories were manipulated for a Dutch national news website (NOS.nl). For each story, four variants were developed: Text containing hyperlinks, plain text only, citing the sources directly, citing in the words of the journalist. Dependent variables were perceived control, appreciation, and absorption in the story. Results showed that news stories with hyperlinked sources affected perceived control positively, especially for those with a high desirability of control. Directness of speech did not have any effects. The relation between hypertext and appreciation was mediated by perceived control.",

        "Abstract": "Social media and online services with user-generated content (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube) have made a staggering amount of information (and misinformation) available. Government officials seek to leverage these resources to improve services and communication with citizens. Significant potential exists to identify issues in real time, so emergency managers can monitor and respond to issues concerning public safety. Yet, the sheer volume of social data streams generates substantial noise that must be filtered in order to detect meaningful patterns and trends. Important events can then be identified as spikes in activity, while event meaning and consequences can be deciphered by tracking changes in content and public sentiment. This paper presents findings from a exploratory study we conducted between June and December 2010 with government officials in Arlington, VA (and the greater National Capitol Region around Washington, D.C.), with the broad goal of understanding social media use by government officials as well as community organizations, businesses, and the public at large. A key objective was also to understand social media use specifically for managing crisis situations from the routine (e.g., traffic, weather crises) to the critical (e.g., earthquakes, floods).",

After reviewing the literature, four topic modeling algorithms were successfully implemented using Python code: (1) LDA, (2) phrase-LDA, (3) DMM, and (4) NMF. Analysis of the top ten topics from each algorithm indicated that LDA, phrase- LDA, and NMF show the most promise for future analysis on larger sets of data (from three or more semesters) and for examining different facets of the data (fall versus spring semester, different time of day, just the patron side of the conversation).",

While the formal modeling behind VIBE and other information visualization retrieval systems is well known, user interaction with the system is not. This investigation tested the designer assumption that VIBE is a tool for a smart (expert) user and asked: What are the effects of the different levels of user expertise upon VIBE usability? Three user groups including novices, online searching experts, and VIBE system experts totaling 31 participants were tested over two sessions with VIBE. Participants selected appropriate features to complete tasks, but did not always solve the tasks correctly. Task timings improved over repeated use with VIBE and the nontypical visually oriented tasks were resolved more successfully than others. Statistically significant differences were not found among all parameters examined between novices and online experts. The VIBE system experts provided the predicted baseline for this study and the VIBE designer assumption was shown to be correct. The study's results point toward further exploration of cognitive preattentive processing, which may help to understand better the novice/expert paradigm when testing a visualized interface design for information retrieval.",

This longitudinal study of the subject terms associated with published journal articles allows for a clearer understanding of the field of institutional repositories as it developed, evolved, and changed over time. This study's uniqueness lies in its longitudinal nature, and its use of information visualization, multidimensional scaling, and parallel coordinate analysis provide information regarding the field of institutional repositories. The multidimensional scaling and parallel coordinate analysis in conjunction with temporal analysis reveal that institutional repositories transitioned through several development phases. Future studies of institutional repositories will most likely discover evaluation tactics and potential guidelines, resulting in a need for additional case studies. Observations from the parallel coordinate analysis reveal three major themes. The first theme is the maturity of institutional repositories as a field over time, the second is the fluctuation and developmental status of institutional repositories until 2010-2013 (Period IV), and the third theme is the emergence of the discipline information science and library science as the strong generator of institutional repository research. Through the visualization and temporal analysis, information was gained regarding the history, development, and future studies within institutional repositories.",

We concluded that S&T visuals vary across cultures, the variations between designs comprise a spectrum of visual-textual and textualvisual correlations, and the similarities and differences between the visuals are caused by diverse individual and contextual factors.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to review the basic principles of qualitative analysis, and examine the practical application of these principles to analyze student assignments using the ATLAS.ti software. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Student comments from an assignment are prepared for import into ATLAS.ti. The comments are coded, and then analyzed for patterns using ATLAS.ti and its mechanisms for exploring data and data patterns. Findings \u2013 ATLAS.ti offers myriad analytic tools that allow the researcher to quantify qualitative information through coding, data query, cross-tabulation, and networked visualization of project design. By developing both technical expertise with the software, and developing familiarity with qualitative methodology, librarians can wield an effective means to assess and evaluate text-based data, such as student assignments or surveys. Research limitations/implications \u2013 Because the ATLAS.ti software, and the qualitative analysis process itself is so complex, this article can only outline the most prominent aspects of the tool. Practical implications \u2013 The document can serve as a \"jumping-off\" point for other researchers wishing to either explore the qualitative analysis process, particularly as conducted with ATLAS.ti. The reader will become more familiar with the basic concepts of qualitative analysis as reflected in the organization and functions of the ATLAS.ti, as well as the process of preparing and analyzing textual information with ATLAS.ti. Originality/value \u2013 Because there is a general lack of literature on setting up a project with the software, the article is potentially valuable to anyone wishing to expand and improve their evaluative skills using ATLAS.ti or similar tools.",

        "Abstract": "Legacy data from natural history collections contain invaluable and irreplaceable information about biodiversity in the recent past, providing a baseline for detecting change and forecasting the future of biodiversity on a human-dominated planet. However, these data are often not available in formats that facilitate use and synthesis. New approaches are needed to enhance the rates of digitization and data quality improvement. Notes from Nature provides one such novel approach by asking citizen scientists to help with transcription tasks. The initial web-based prototype of Notes from Nature is soon widely available and was developed collaboratively by biodiversity scientists, natural history collections staff, and experts in citizen science project development, programming and visualization. This project brings together digital images representing different types of biodiversity records including ledgers , herbarium sheets and pinned insects from multiple projects and natural history collections. Experts in developing web-based citizen science applications then designed and built a platform for transcribing textual data and metadata from these images. The end product is a fully open source web transcription tool built using the latest web technologies. The platform keeps volunteers engaged by initially explaining the scientific importance of the work via a short orientation, and then providing transcription \"missions\" of well defined scope, along with dynamic feedback, interactivity and rewards. Transcribed records, along with record-level and process metadata, are provided back to the institutions. While the tool is being developed with new users in mind, it can serve a broad range of needs from novice to trained museum specialist. Notes from Nature has the potential to speed the rate of biodiversity data being made available to a broad community of users.",

        "Abstract": "Some typographers have proposed that typeface familiarity is defined by the amount of time that a reader has been exposed to a typeface design, while other typographers have proposed that familiarity is defined by the commonalities in letter shapes. These two hypotheses were tested by measuring the reading speed and preferences of participants. Participants were tested twice with common and uncommon letter shapes, once before and once after spending 20 minutes reading a story with the font. The results indicate that the exposure period has an effect on the speed of reading, but the uncommon letter shapes did not. Readers did not like the uncommon letter shapes.

Kuhlthau's (1993) Stage 3, the exploration stage of researching an assignment, they often do not know their information need; this causes them to go back to Stage 2, the topic-selection stage, when they are selecting keywords to formulate their query to an Information Retrieval (IR) system. Our hypothesis is that instead of going backward, they should be going forward toward a goal state\u2014the performance of the task for which they are seeking the information. If they can somehow construct their goal state into a query, this forward-looking query better operationalizes their information need than does a topic-based query. For domain novice undergraduates seeking information for a course essay, we define their task as selecting a high-impact essay structure which will put the students' learning on display for the course instructor who will evaluate the essay. We report a study of first-year history undergraduate students which tested the use and effectiveness of \u201cessay type\u201d as a task-focused query-formulation device. We randomly assigned 78 history undergraduates to an intervention group and a control group. The dependent variable was essay quality, based on (a) an evaluation of the student's essay by a research team member, and (b) the marks given to the student's essay by the course instructor. We found that conscious or formal consideration of essay type is inconclusive as a basis of a task-focused query-formulation device for IR.",

The R program, VOS-viewer software, and Webometric Analyst 2.0 were used for the analysis. The results of this investigation unveil that the literature on the stellar and galactic astrophysics has grown exponentially during this period reaching 4352 papers in total. A network visualization map revealed that \"galaxies: active\", \"stars: neutron\", \"galaxies: evolution\", \"galaxies: ism\" and \"radio continuum: galaxies\" were the most frequently used keywords. The study identified the key scientometric indicators such as publications, authors, journals, countries, institutions, citation, and co-citation analysis. \"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research\" (TIFR) is the most extensive institutional contributor publishing 26.03% of the papers. Srianand R is the most published author with 143 publications. India has the most significant scientific collaboration with the USA. \"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society\" is the most publishing journal with 1434 published papers having 25,853 citations.

        "Abstract": "Abstract: Functional dependencies (FDs) and inclusion dependencies (INDs) convey most of data semantics in relational databases and are very useful in practice since they generalize keys and foreign keys. Nevertheless, FDs and INDs are often not available, obsolete or lost in real-life databases. Several algorithms have been proposed for mining these dependencies, but the output is always in the same format: a simple list of dependencies, hard to understand for the user. In this paper, we define informative Armstrong databases (IADBs) from databases as being small subsets of an existing database, satisfying exactly the same FDs and INDs. They are an extension of the classical notion of Armstrong databases, but more suitable for the understanding of dependencies, since tuples are real-world tuples. The main result of this paper is to bound the size of an IADB in the case of non-circular INDs. A constructive proof of this result is given, from which an algorithm has been devised. An implementation and experiments against a real-life database were performed; the obtained database contains 0.6% of the initial database tuples only. More importantly, such semantic sampling of databases appear to be a key feature for the understanding of existing databases at the logical level.",

        "Abstract": "This article describes a quantitative approach to the study of group dynamics in Collaborative Information Visualization Environments (CIVEs). This approach characterizes group dynamics in terms of two concepts introduced in this article\u2014spatial proximity and semantic coherence. The concepts are crucial to the understanding of profound interrelationships between spatial, semantic, and social navigation. Furthermore, this article describes three visualization techniques\u2014semantic indentation chat sequence displays, activity maps, and clock-face maps\u2014that permit the identification of important features of group interaction that are related to semantic coherence and spatial proximity. The approach is illustrated by applying it to the analysis of an empirical study in which four groups of subjects performed collaborative search tasks through 3D visualizations of knowledge domains. The major contribution of the work is the conceptualization and quantification of group coherence as a generic methodology for the study of a range of collaborative virtual environments such as collaborative learning, distance learning, social networks, collaborative information visualization, and digital libraries. Further research challenges for the study of group behavior in collaborative information-visualization environments are identified.",

        "Abstract": "The scholarly output of the new coronavirus research has been proliferating. During five months, an amount of 14,588 scientific publications about nCoV-2 and COVID-19 has been generated intensively (as indexed in Scopus on 31 May 2020). Such a knowledge outburst has created ample interest in understanding the research landscape of this newly configured area. This paper demonstrates on scientometric dimensions of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) research using quantifiable characteristics of the publication dataset. Findings reveal that the rate of publication growth (1600%) is very significant to a synergic response of the researchers to combat with the most extended sequence of an RNA virus. Indeed their response has geared up to an average of 100 articles per day. Many scholarly publishers have disclosed their preprint servers to make the publications available immediately, even by enabling Open Access. The scientific contents have published in more than 500 journals from 240 academic publishers. While the top-ten publishers occupied almost 70% of the articles, then about 25% of the studies were sponsored by 300 funding agencies. Among the notable journals Lancet, Nature, BMJ, JAMA, JMV, and NEJM are prominent. Findings also reveal that majority of the contributions have occurred in Medical Science, focusing on virology, immunology, epidemiology, pharmacology, public health, critical care, and emergency medicine. However, the closely associated terms are virus transmission, infection control, asymptomatic, quarantine, pneumonia, human, disease severity, clinical trials, viral pathogenesis, pandemic, risk, and mortality. The study suggests that academic hubs are located mostly in the USA, China, Italy, and the UK. Among the productive institutions; Huazhong Univ (China), Tongji Med. College (China), Harvard Med. School (USA), Univ of Milan (Italy), INSERM (France), UCL (UK) are outstanding. The G7 countries together produced 50% of the global research output on nCov-2. It also noted an encouraging trend of collaborative research across many countries and disciplines, where the values of CI (6.46), DC (0.79), and CC (0.59) are very significant. It examines the geographical diversity of the collaborating authors, thereby visualized their linkages via co-authorship occurrences. Finally, it analyzed the publications' impact to showcase the most influential contributions of the new coronavirus research.",

        "Abstract": "Social navigation exploits the knowledge and experience of peer users of information resources. A wide variety of visual\u2013spatial approaches become increasingly popular as a means to optimize information access as well as to foster and sustain a virtual community among geographically distributed users. An information landscape is among the most appealing design options of representing and communicating the essence of distributed information resources to users. A fundamental and challenging issue is how an information landscape can be designed such that it will not only preserve the essence of the underlying information structure, but also accommodate the diversity of individual users. The majority of research in social navigation has been focusing on how to extract useful information from what is in common between users'' profiles, their interests and preferences. In this article, we explore the role of modelling sequential behaviour patterns of users in augmenting social navigation in thematic landscapes. In particular, we compare and analyse the trails of individual users in thematic spaces along with their cognitive ability measures. We are interested in whether such trails can provide useful guidance for social navigation if they are embedded in a visual\u2013spatial environment. Furthermore, we are interested in whether such information can help users to learn from each other, for example, from the ones who have been successful in retrieving documents. In this article, we first describe how users'' trails in sessions of an experimental study of visual information retrieval can be characterized by Hidden Markov Models. Trails of users with the most successful retrieval performance are used to estimate parameters of such models. Optimal virtual trails generated from the models are visualized and animated as if they were actual trails of individual users in order to highlight behavioural patterns that may foster social navigation. The findings of the research will provide direct input to the design of social navigation systems as well as to enrich theories of social navigation in a wider context. These findings will lead to the further development and consolidation of a tightly coupled paradigm of spatial, semantic and social navigation.",

Social bookmarking sites aggregate datasets of often hundreds of millions of triples (document, user, and tag), which, when interpreted as edges of a graph, give rise to special networks called 3-partite, 3-uniform hypergraphs. We identify challenges and opportunities of generalizing community detection and in particular modularity optimization to these structures. Two methods for community detection are introduced that preserve the hypergraph's special structure to different degrees. Their performance is compared on synthetic datasets, showing the benefits of structure preservation. Furthermore, a tool for interactive exploration of the community detection results is introduced and applied to examples from real datasets. We find additional evidence for the importance of structure preservation and, more generally, demonstrate how tripartite community detection can help understand the structure of social bookmarking data.",

        "Abstract": "Interactive mapping and spatial analysis tools are under-utilized by health researchers and decision-makers as a result of scarce training materials, few examples demonstrating the successful use of geographic visualization, and poor mechanisms for sharing results generated by geovisualization. Here, we report on the development of the Geovisual EXplication(G-EX) Portal, a web-based application designed to connect researchers in geovisualization and related mapping sciences, to users who are working in public health and epidemiology. This paper focuses on the design and development of the G-EX Portal Learn module, a set of tools intended to disseminate learning artifacts. Initial design and development of the G-EX Portal has been guided by our past research on the use and usability of geovisualization in public health. As part of the iterative design and development process, we conducted a needs assessment survey with targeted end-users, which we report on here. The survey focused on users\u2019 current learning habits, their preferred kind of learning artifacts and issues they may have with contributing learning artifacts to web portals. Survey results showed that users desire a diverse set of learning artifacts in terms of both formats and topics covered. Results also revealed a willingness of users to contribute both learning artifacts and personal information that would help other users to evaluate the credibility of the learning artifact source. We include a detailed description of the G-EX Portal Learn module and focus on modifications to the design of the Learn module as a result from feedback we received from our survey.",

        "Abstract": "Organizations using controlled vocabularies are highly diverse, but they all rely on using a terminology list that is internally standardized, commonly understood and widely applied for metatagging. The basic steps for creating a controlled vocabulary, taxonomy or thesaurus are the same for each case, starting with determining the scope to be covered and identifying representative content sources. This step is followed by gathering and organizing terms, enhancing them with synonyms and relationships and often by subjectmatter- expert review. Using a dedicated taxonomy management tool is recommended to facilitate management, visualization and export in machine-readable format such as OWL or SKOS. Posting the controlled vocabulary to a registry or data warehouse enables sharing and may stimulate broad acceptance. The MITRE Corporation has followed this process in developing taxonomies consistent with the Department of Defense's Net-Centric Data Strategy, which bases shared understanding within and among DoD programs on the use of controlled vocabularies and crosswalking equivalent data elements.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Background: A survey of microarray databases reveals that most of the repository contents and data models are heterogeneous (i.e., data obtained from different chip manufacturers), and that the repositories provide only basic biological keywords linking to PubMed. As a result, it is difficult to find datasets using research context or analysis parameters information beyond a few keywords. For example, to reduce the \"curse-of-dimension\" problem in microarray analysis, the number of samples is often increased by merging array data from different datasets. Knowing chip data parameters such as pre-processing steps (e.g., normalization, artefact removal, etc), and knowing any previous biological validation of the dataset is essential due to the heterogeneity of the data. However, most of the microarray repositories do not have meta-data information in the first place, and do not have a a mechanism to add or insert this information. Thus, there is a critical need to create \"intelligent\" microarray repositories that (1) enable update of metadata with the raw array data, and (2) provide standardized archiving protocols to minimize bias from the raw data sources. Results: To address the problems discussed, we have developed a community maintained system called ArrayWiki that unites disparate meta-data of microarray meta-experiments from multiple primary sources with four key features. First, ArrayWiki provides a user-friendly knowledge management interface in addition to a programmable interface using standards developed by Wikipedia. Second, ArrayWiki includes automated quality control processes (caCORRECT) and novel visualization methods (BioPNG, Gel Plots), which provide extra information about data quality unavailable in other microarray repositories. Third, it provides a user-curation capability through the familiar Wiki interface. Fourth, ArrayWiki provides users with simple text-based searches across all experiment meta-data, and exposes data to search engine crawlers (Semantic Agents) such as Google to further enhance data discovery. Conclusions: Microarray data and meta information in ArrayWiki are distributed and visualized using a novel and compact data storage format, BioPNG. Also, they are open to the research community for curation, modification, and contribution. By making a small investment of time to learn the syntax and structure common to all sites running MediaWiki software, domain scientists and practioners can all contribute to make better use of microarray technologies in research and medical practices. ArrayWiki is available at http://www.bio-miblab.org/arraywiki.",

An exploration of the subject can be of interest to a wide audience. Objective. To define the major scientific and technical aspects of interplanetary travel and present them to the non-scientific reader. Method. Relevant citations on the subject were obtained from the Inspec database using applicable keywords; the bibliography of four key articles and citations were also retrieved from Inspec. All the classification codes from the citations were compiled. The visualization software Sci2 was used to create subject clusters, and the classification codes related to each cluster were extracted. Result. Six main subject areas were found to represent the main components of interplanetary travel. These are described, together with a list of basic resources. Major publications such as books, journals and conference proceedings obtained from the searches are listed. Contribution. This survey is targeted at librarians, teachers, and others with limited scientific background to provide them with an overview of the scientific and technical aspects of interplanetary travel. This information can be used to prepare information literacy sessions on a topic that can bring active participation and interest in a class. It can help students with non-scientific backgrounds venture into this exciting area. Finally, this can be viewed as a contribution to science literacy.",

Through social networks analysis we intend to detect sub-networks within the Nordic network, the position and role of the different university web domains and to understand the structural topology of this web space. Co-link analysis, with asymmetrical matrices and cosine measure, is used to identify thematic clusters. Results show that the Nordic network is a cohesive network, set up by three well-defined sub-networks and it rests on the Finnish and Swedish sub-networks. We conclude that the Danish network has less visibility than other Nordic countries. The Swedish one is the principal Nordic sub-network and the Finland network is a slightly isolated from Europe, with the exception of the University of Helsinki.",

        "Abstract": "Information seeking skills are becoming increasingly important as rapid and widespread developments in technology have made information available in more formats and from more sources than ever before. Research in human computer interaction (HCI) has demonstrated that primary cognitive abilities represent a powerful predictor of information-seeking success in electronic information systems. Specifically, spatial visualization ability (SVA) seems to be particularly related to hierarchical menus systems navigation within databases, online learning environments, information archival systems, and virtually all internet web sites. Research indicates that individuals with low SVA take longer to complete tasks and experience more errors on first attempts to find information in hierarchical databases compared to those with high SVA. Understanding the influences of SVA as well as its interaction with other aspects of individual differences, such as domain expertise, is critical to the design of systems intended to accommodate individual differences in users.Thirty-five college students (23 males and 12 females) were selected from the general student body of two universities and assigned to groups based upon their self-reported membership in one of two specific disciplines: business <f>(n=26)</f> or biology <f>(n=9)</f>. Participants were then assigned to groups based upon scores on tests of SVA using a median-split. Each participant conducted five searches: one neutral search, two searches for business related information, and two searches for biology related information using the FirstSearch archival search tool.A <f>2\u00d72</f> factorial Analysis of Variance with one between-groups variable (high vs. low SVA) and one within-group variable (high vs. low domain expertise) indicated a significant main effect of SVA as well as a significant main effect of Domain Expertise on the time required to find their first relevant article on the search topic. The analysis also revealed that there was no main effect for SVA on the total number of relevant articles found during the search period but there was a significant main effect of Domain Expertise on the total total-number-of-relevant-articles found. There was no interaction between SVA and Domain Expertise on either time to first article or total number of articles found.Results of the study extend existing knowledge regarding the effects of SVA and domain expertise on information seeking by demonstrating a strong effect of SVA and domain expertise on information seeking skills. The results of this study also provide evidence in support of interface designs that are friendlier to information seekers who have low SVA. Related findings and suggestions for further research are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Objective: </bold>To introduce a disease prognosis framework enabled by a robust classification scheme derived from patient-specific transcriptomic response to stimulation.<bold>Materials and Methods: </bold>Within an illustrative case study to predict asthma exacerbation, we designed a stimulation assay that reveals individualized transcriptomic response to human rhinovirus. Gene expression from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was quantified from 23 pediatric asthmatic patients and stimulated in vitro with human rhinovirus. Responses were obtained via the single-subject gene set testing methodology \"N-of-1-pathways.\" The classifier was trained on a related independent training dataset (n\u2009=\u200919). Novel visualizations of personal transcriptomic responses are provided.<bold>Results: </bold>Of the 23 pediatric asthmatic patients, 12 experienced recurrent exacerbations. Our classifier, using individualized responses and trained on an independent dataset, obtained 74% accuracy (area under the receiver operating curve of 71%; 2-sided P\u2009=\u2009.039). Conventional classifiers using messenger RNA (mRNA) expression within the viral-exposed samples were unsuccessful (all patients predicted to have recurrent exacerbations; accuracy of 52%).<bold>Discussion: </bold>Prognosis based on single time point, static mRNA expression alone neglects the importance of dynamic genome-by-environment interplay in phenotypic presentation. Individualized transcriptomic response quantified at the pathway (gene sets) level reveals interpretable signals related to clinical outcomes.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The proposed framework provides an innovative approach to precision medicine. We show that quantifying personal pathway-level transcriptomic response to a disease-relevant environmental challenge predicts disease progression. This genome-by-environment interaction assay offers a noninvasive opportunity to translate omics data to clinical practice by improving the ability to predict disease exacerbation and increasing the potential to produce more effective treatment decisions.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to investigate user experiences with a touch-wall interface featuring both clustering and categorization representations of available e-books in a public library to understand human information interactions under work-focused and recreational contexts. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Researchers collected questionnaires from 251 New Taipei City Library visitors who used the touch-wall interface to search for new titles. The authors applied structural equation modelling to examine relationships among hedonic/utilitarian needs, clustering and categorization representations, perceived ease of use (EU) and the extent to which users experienced anxiety and uncertainty (AU) while interacting with the interface. Findings \u2013 Utilitarian users who have an explicit idea of what they intend to find tend to prefer the categorization interface. A hedonic-oriented user tends to prefer clustering interfaces. Users reported EU regardless of which interface they engaged with. Results revealed that use of the clustering interface had a negative correlation with AU. Users that seek to satisfy utilitarian needs tended to emphasize the importance of perceived EU, whilst pleasure-seeking users were a little more tolerant of anxiety or uncertainty. Originality/value \u2013 The Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) encourages library visitors to borrow digital books through the implementation of an information visualization system. This situation poses an opportunity to validate uses and gratification theory. People with hedonic/utilitarian needs displayed different risk-control attitudes and affected uncertainty using the interface. Knowledge about user interaction with such interfaces is vital when launching the development of a new OPAC.",

Compositional biplots are used for data visualisation. Unlike traditional approaches, compositional analysis in general, and the biplot in particular, emphasise the relative salience of issues within the agenda. This analysis sheds light on the agenda-setting theory and closely-related phenomena such as priming (based on associative-activation among a group of issues that are more influential than others) and the spiral of silence (the issues derived from the hierarchy process of agenda-setting that are omitted just after the election day).",

This paper aims to establish digital forensics and data exploration as a methodology for supporting archival practice and research into a filmmaker's creative processes. We approach this by exploring the digital legacy hard drives of the late artist Stephen Dwoskin (1939\u20132012), who is recognised as an influential filmmaker at the forefront of the shift from analogue to digital film production. The research findings of this case study show that digital forensics is effective in extracting a timeline of hard drive activities, data that can be explored to reveal clues about the artist's personal/professional history, stages of creative processes, and technical environment. The paper further demonstrates how this is related to current thinking around user-centred archival workflow and understanding of creative processes. The broader impact of the work for advancing digital archiving and research into creative processes is highlighted, concluding with a discussion of how, going forward, the approach can be coupled with deeper content analysis to reveal what influences editing choices taking place over time.",

Document sets are presented through combinations of traditional ranked lists and 2-dimensional proximity-based visualisations, created by uniting graph-theoretic clustering and force-directed layout techniques, where article positions are determined by inter-document similarities. By using Gestalt principles and information encoding, the simple layout improves search efficiency by leveraging human cognitive strengths that have generally been under-utilised in commercial GUI development. In this paper, design and realisation of the layout technique are described in the context of an article browsing framework. Results of an indicative comparative laboratory study, which evaluates the client application \u2014 and in particular Graph-Theoretic Force-Directed (GTFD) visualisations against traditional search engine interfaces \u2014 are then presented. This study demonstrates the advantage of graphical presentations when browsing an article collection.

Posts were represented using lexicon-based tools, including Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, Empath, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and also using pretrained artificial neural network models, including DeepMoji, Universal Sentence Encoder, and Generative Pretrained Transformer-1 (GPT-1). We used Tree-based Optimization Tool and Auto-Sklearn as AutoML tools to generate classifiers to triage the posts.<bold>Results: </bold>The top-performing system used features derived from the GPT-1 model, which was fine-tuned on over 150,000 unlabeled posts from Reachout.com. Our top system had a macroaveraged F1 score of 0.572, providing a new state-of-the-art result on the CLPsych 2017 task. This was achieved without additional information from metadata or preceding posts. Error analyses revealed that this top system often misses expressions of hopelessness. In addition, we have presented visualizations that aid in the understanding of the learned classifiers.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>In this study, we found that transfer learning is an effective strategy for predicting risk with relatively little labeled data and noted that fine-tuning of pretrained language models provides further gains when large amounts of unlabeled text are available.",

        "Abstract": "The Related Records feature in the Web of Science retrieves records that share at least one item in their reference lists with the references of a seed record. This search method, known as bibliographic coupling, does not always yield topically relevant results. Our exploratory case study asks: How do retrievals of the type used in pennant diagrams compare with retrievals through Related Records? Pennants are two-dimensional visualizations of documents co-cited with a seed paper. In them, the well-known tf*idf (term frequency*inverse document frequency) formula is used to weight the co-citation counts. The weights have psychological interpretations from relevance theory; given the seed, tf predicts a co-cited document's cognitive effects on the user, and idf predicts the user's relative ease in relating its title to the seed's title. We chose two seed papers from information science, one with only two references and the other with 20, and used them to retrieve 50 documents per method in WoS for each of our two seeds. We illustrate with pennant diagrams. Pennant retrieval indeed produced more relevant documents, especially for the paper with only two references, and it produced mostly different ones. Related Records performed almost as well on the paper with the longer reference list, improving remarkably as the coupling units between the seed and other papers increased. We argue that relevance rankings based on co-citation, with pennant-style weighting as an option, would be a desirable addition to WoS and similar databases.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>The recent proliferation of digital health technology in low- and middle-income countries has made it possible for community health workers (CHWs) to use mobile health (mHealth) to perform tasks such as data collection and training. Although most studies focus on the prospect of digital apps to motivate and connect CHW, only a few have captured end-user experiences with mobile-based apps. We examined the experience of frontline health workers with a move towards digitalized real-time data to record maternal and childcare services in remote areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.<bold>Objective: </bold>Our study aimed to explore CHW perceptions on the operability of the mHealth app in a community setting, usefulness of the app in the delivery of assigned maternal and childcare functions, and the task-technology fit with monitoring information systems.<bold>Methods: </bold>The Hayat app, designed to digitalize and facilitate electronic record keeping, was evaluated to be embedded into mainstream health systems. The app had 2 components: smartphone app for data entry and web dashboard for visualization of the maternal, newborn, and child health reports. Using a qualitative exploratory study design, we conducted a total of 8 focus group discussions with purposively selected lady health workers (LHWs) and CHWs in 3 districts of Pakistan and 3 hamlets of Afghanistan, respectively. Focus group discussions were conducted in the local language, audio recorded, and converted into expanded notes for thematic analysis.<bold>Results: </bold>Although a majority of LHWs used the app with ease, some initially faced difficulties in operating it and requested a longer duration of training. Contrary to LHWs, the CHWs were able to use the app without difficulty, as they were using it only to register clients. Overall, use of the mHealth app in both countries resulted in a positive impact on health education sessions, easier communication with parents or clients, tracking of routine immunization defaulters and follow-ups, improved data validity, easily accessible vaccination schedules, and faster registration. In addition to building up their image in the community and personal development, the improved reporting and monitoring mechanisms also set the stage for the LHWs to get recognized for their hard work. CHWs in Afghanistan also reported the app provided immediate access to information when requested by their supervisor. Although the Hayat app eliminates the need to carry multiple registers and helps in recalling client information at the touch of a button, technical issues around connectivity and data inputting tabs were highlighted by the participants.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The digitization of records not only provided CHWs support in their daily routine but also strengthened monitoring mechanisms and improved motivation. We recommend conducting end user experience studies before embedding apps into mainstream health systems as high acceptability does not always result in high uptake of digital technology.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Worldwide, the number of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is predicted to double between the years 2005 and 2030. Chronic care management requires active collaboration and knowledge exchange between patients and health care professionals (HCPs) for best possible health outcomes, which we describe as co-care. eHealth services have the potential to support the realization of co-care between people with PD (PwP) and HCPs.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aimed to explore how co-care could be operationalized in PD care, supported by eHealth. More specifically, this study explores PwP's and HCPs' expectations and desired eHealth functionalities to achieve co-care.<bold>Methods: </bold>Principles of participatory design were used to enable the identification of co-care needs and design ideas, in a series of 4 half-day co-design workshops. The sample included 7 (4 women) PwP and 9 (4 women) HCPs, including 4 neurologists, 3 nurses, and 2 physiotherapists. The co-design process resulted in a functional prototype that was evaluated by the co-design participants in the last workshop. Data were collected through note cards produced by the participants during the first 3 workshops and focus group discussions during the 3rd and 4th workshops. The data were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. After the workshop series, the prototype was demonstrated at a Mini Fair for ongoing PD research and evaluated using a self-developed questionnaire with 37 respondents: 31 PwP (14 women) and 6 informal caregivers (3 women). Descriptive statistics are reported.<bold>Results: </bold>The qualitative analysis of data resulted in 2 main themes. The first theme, core eHealth functionalities and their expected values, describes 6 desired eHealth functionalities for supporting PD co-care between PwP and HCPs: (1) self-tracking, (2) previsit forms, (3) graphical visualization, (4) clinical decision support, (5) self-care recommendations, and (6) asynchronous communication. The second theme, individual and organizational constraints, describes constraints that need to be addressed to succeed with an eHealth service for co-care. Individual constraints include eHealth literacy and acceptance; organizational constraints include teamwork and administrative workload. The majority of the questionnaire respondents (31/37, 84%) perceived that they would benefit from an eHealth service similar to the demonstrated prototype. All prototype functionalities were rated as very important or important by the majority of respondents (ranging from 86% to 97% per functionality).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This study adds to our knowledge on how PD co-care could be operationalized. Co-care implies a shift from episodic routine-driven care to more flexible care management that is driven by the mutual needs of patients and HCPs and supported by active information exchange between them, as well as automated information processing to generate patient-specific advice. More research is needed to further explore the concept of co-care in chronic care management and what it means for self-care and health care.<bold>International Registered Report Identifier (irrid): </bold>RR2-10.2196/11278.",

        "Abstract": "Designing information-seeking systems has become an increasingly complex task as today\u2019s information spaces are rapidly growing in quantity, heterogeneity, and dimensionality. The challenge is to provide user interfaces that have a satisfying usability and user experience even for novice users. Although information visualization and interaction design offer solutions, many information-seeking systems such as online catalogs for libraries or web search engines continue to use outdated user-interface concepts developed decades ago. In this paper, we will present four principles that we identified as crucial for the successful design of a modern visual information-seeking system. These are (1) to support various ways of formulating an information need, (2) to integrate analytical and browsing-oriented ways of exploration, (3) to provide views on different dimensions of the information space, and (4) to make search a pleasurable experience. These design principles are based on our experience over a long period in the user-centered design and evaluation of visual information-seeking systems. Accordingly, we will showcase individual designs from our own work of the past 10 years to illustrate each principle and hence narrow the gap between the scientific discussion and the designing practitioner that has often hindered research ideas from becoming reality. However, most of the times search is only one part of a higher level user activity (e.g. writing a paper). Thus future research should focus on the challenges when regarding search in such a broader context. We will use the final two chapters to point out some of these challenges and outline our vision of an integrated and consistent digital work environment named Zoomable Object-oriented Information Landscape.",

It is necessary to develop CS taxonomy research to combine its historical perspective, its current knowledge and its predicted future trends - including all breakthroughs in information and communication technology. In this paper we have analyzed the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS) by means of visualization maps. The important achievement of current work is an effective visualization of classified documents from the ACM Digital Library. From the technical point of view, the innovation lies in the parallel use of analysis units: (sub)classes and keywords as well as a spherical 3D information surface. We have compared both the thematic and semantic maps of classified documents and results presented in Table 1. Furthermore, the proposed new method is used for content-related evaluation of the original scheme. Summing up: we improved an original ACM classification in the Computer Science domain by means of visualization.",

We present three tools for quantitatively analysing encoded qualitative data: relevance-criteria profile, relevance-judgement complexity and session visualisation. Relevance-criteria profiles capture the prominence of each criterion usage with respect to the search sessions of individuals or selected user groups (e.g. groups defined by the users affiliations and/or level of research experience). Relevance-judgement complexity, on the other hand, reflects the number of criteria involved in a single judgment process. Finally, session visualisation brings these results together in a sequential representation of criteria usage and relevance judgements throughout a session, potentially allowing the researcher to quickly detect emerging patterns with respect to interactions, relevance criteria usage and complexity. The use of these tools is demonstrated using results from a pilot-user study that was conducted at the Robert Gordon University in 2008. We conclude by highlighting how these tools might be used to support the improvement of end-user services in digital libraries.",

Often, each researcher (or someone in their team) duplicates this effort for their own project, facing the same challenges and experiencing the same pitfalls discovered by those before them.<bold>Objective: </bold>This paper described a design process for creating a data warehouse that includes the most frequently used databases in health services research.<bold>Methods: </bold>The design is based on a conceptual iterative process model framework that utilizes the sociotechnical systems theory approach and includes the capacity for subsequent updates of the existing data sources and the addition of new ones. We introduce the theory and the framework and then explain how they are used to inform the methodology of this study.<bold>Results: </bold>The application of the iterative process model to the design research process of problem identification and solution design for the Healthcare Research and Analytics Data Infrastructure Solution (HRADIS) is described. Each phase of the iterative model produced end products to inform the implementation of HRADIS. The analysis phase produced the problem statement and requirements documents. The projection phase produced a list of tasks and goals for the ideal system. Finally, the synthesis phase provided the process for a plan to implement HRADIS. HRADIS structures and integrates data dictionaries provided by the data sources, allowing the creation of dimensions and measures for a multidimensional business intelligence system. We discuss how HRADIS is complemented with a set of data mining, analytics, and visualization tools to enable researchers to more efficiently apply multiple methods to a given research project. HRADIS also includes a built-in security and account management framework for data governance purposes to ensure customized authorization depending on user roles and parts of the data the roles are authorized to access.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>To address existing inefficiencies during the obtaining, extracting, preprocessing, cleansing, and filtering stages of data processing in health services research, we envision HRADIS as a full-service data warehouse integrating frequently used data sources, processes, and methods along with a variety of data analytics and visualization tools.

        "Abstract": "Web searchers commonly have difficulties crafting queries to fulfill their information needs; even after they are able to craft a query, they often find it challenging to evaluate the results of their Web searches. Sources of these problems include the lack of support for constructing and refining queries, and the static nature of the list-based representations of Web search results. WordBars has been developed to assist users in their Web search and exploration tasks. This system provides a visual representation of the frequencies of the terms found in the first 100 document surrogates returned from an initial query, in the form of a histogram. Exploration of the search results is supported through term selection in the histogram, resulting in a re-sorting of the search results based on the use of the selected terms in the document surrogates. Terms from the histogram can be easily added or removed from the query, generating a new set of search results. Examples illustrate how WordBars can provide valuable support for query refinement and search results exploration, both when vague and specific initial queries are provided. User evaluations with both expert and intermediate Web searchers illustrate the benefits of the interactive exploration features of WordBars in terms of effectiveness as well as subjective measures. Although differences were found in the demographics of these two user groups, both were able to benefit from the features of WordBars.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose \u2013 Personal projects are any kind of projects whose management is left to an individual untrained in project management and is greatly influenced by this individual\u2019s personal touch. This includes the majority of knowledge workers who daily manage information relating to several personal projects. The authors have conducted an in-depth qualitative investigation on information management of such projects and the tacit knowledge behind its processes that cannot be found in the organisational structures of current personal information management (PIM) tools (file managers, e-mail clients, web browsers). The purpose of this paper is to reveal and understand project information management practices in details and provide guidelines for personal project management tools. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Semi-structured interviews similar to that in several other PIM exploratory studies were carried out focusing on project fragmentation, information overlap and project context recreation. In addition, the authors enhanced interviews with sketching approach not yet used to study PIM. Sketches were used for articulating things that were not easily expressed through words, they represented a time stamp of a project context in the projects\u2019 lifetime, uncovered additional tacit knowledge behind project information management not mentioned during the interviews, and were also used to find what they have in common which might be used in prototype designing. Findings \u2013 The paper presents first personal project definition based on the conceptualisations derived from the study. The study revealed that the extensive information fragmentation in the file hierarchy (due to different organisational needs and ease of information access) poses a significant challenge to context recreation besides cross-tool fragmentation so far described in the literature. The study also reveals the division of project information into core and support and emphasises the importance of support information in relation to project goals. Other findings uncover the division of input/output information, project overlaps through information reuse, storytelling and visualising information relations, which could help with user modelling and enhancing project context recreation. Research limitations/implications \u2013 On of the limitations is the group of participants that cannot represent the ideally generalised knowledge worker as there are many different kinds of knowledge workers and they all have different information needs besides different management practices. However, participants of variety of different backgrounds were observed and the authors converged observations into points of project information management similarities across the spectrum of different professions. Nevertheless, its observations and conceptualisations should be repeatable. For one, some of the issues that emerged during this work have been to different extents discussed in other studies. Practical implications \u2013 The empirical findings are used to create guidelines for designing personal project information management tools: support the selective focus on information with the division into core and supportive information; visualise changes in project information space to support narratives for context recreation; overcome fragmentation in the file system with selective unification; visualising project\u2019s information relationship to better understand the complexity of project information space; and support navigating in project information space on two axes: time and between projects (overlaps through information). Originality/value \u2013 The study presents a longitudinal insight into personal project information management. As such it provides a first formal definition of personal project from the information point of view. The method used in the study presented uses a new approach \u2013 sketching in which participants externalised and visualised personal information and projects they discussed. The insights derived from the study form design implications for personal project management tools for knowledge workers.",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The Q&A analysis method allowed first-hand investigation of massive data from health care consumers. Visual term clustering analysis across categories was conducted using a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) visualization method which provides an intuitive and interactive way to explore and discover term association patterns in a visual environment. Closely related categories were identified and corresponding visual term clustering analyses between categories (Sign & Symptom and Organ & Body Part; Diagnosis and Test; and Diagnosis and Medication) as well at the term level were analyzed. Findings \u2013 The findings show that there are close relationships between terms in two related categories. Related terms were grouped and patterns were revealed. All the stress values of the MDS analyses fall below 0.10 and RSQ for each of the combined categories is over 0.90 which indicate the investigated terms were well clustered in the visual analyses. Originality/value \u2013 The study provides a unique research methodology for similar consumer health research studies. The results of this study offer insight into consumer health term use behavior, and enrich existing thesauri and subject heading lists, enhance diabetes-related web sites or portals, and improve effectiveness of internal search engines.",

        "Abstract": "It is the purpose of this paper to make explicit the methodology (the theory of the methods) by which we conducted research for an Economic and Social Research Council-funded research project on the relationship of values to value. Specifically, we wanted to study the imperative of Facebook to monetize social relationships, what happens when one of our significant forms of communication is driven by the search for profit, by the logic of capital. We therefore wanted to \u2018get inside\u2019 and understand what capital's new lines of flight, informationally driven models of economic expansion, do to social relations. Taking up the challenge to develop methods appropriate to the challenges of \u2018big data', we applied four different methods to investigate the interface that is Facebook: we designed custom software tools, generated an online survey, developed data visualizations, and conducted interviews with participants to discuss their understandings of our analysis. We used Lefebvre's [(2004).Rhythmnanalysis: Space, time and everyday life. London: Continuum] rhythmanalysis and Kember and Zylinska's [(2012).Life after new media: Mediation as a vital process.Cambridge, MA: MIT Press] ideas about \u2018lifeness\u2019 to inform our methodology. This paper reports on a research process that was not entirely straightforward. We were thwarted in a variety of ways, especially by challenge to use software to study software and had to develop our project in unanticipated directions, but we also found much more than we initially imagined possible. As so few academic researchers are able to study Facebook through its own tools (as Tufekci [(2014). Big questions for social media big data: Representativeness, validity and other methodological pitfalls. In ICWSM \u201814: Proceedings of the 8th International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (pp.\u00a0505\u2013514)] notes how, unsurprisingly, at the 2013 ICWSM only about 5% of papers were about Facebook and nearly all of these were co-authored with Facebook data scientists), we hope that our methodology is useful for other researchers seeking to develop less conventional research on Facebook.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: Statistical representations in the popular almanacs published at the end of the 19th century in the Habsburg Empire are an early prototype of visualizing statistical data for popular consumption and informing the public of an ethnically and linguistically differentiated society. The purpose of this article is to analyze these statistical representations using a combination of humanistic and visual analysis methods. The article focuses on the persuasive aspects (rhetoric) of diagrams, how they visualize knowledge and information (pragmatics), and the nature and structure of visual sense making (semantics). The form and content are related to the social context and materiality of images. These early popular diagrams predate functional design defined by positivism and science. They are interpreted as a historical practice of knowledge visualization in the context of a post-Enlightenment information regime (epitomizing rational government and the privileged position of statistics as instrument of increasing the efficiency and social control of the state). The modernist approach shapes the same information regime in information science discourse. The analysis\u2014based on principles of information visualization and functional design requirements\u2014shows that these examples possess a sound visual structure based on functional design criteria, and that they integrate cultural context without distorting the data. The advantages of naturalistic and culturally rich visualizations that enable ordinary citizens to acquire knowledge through leveraging simple visual reasoning skills, reliance on mental models, and narrative conventions are identified.",

        "Abstract": "Traditional approaches to postmarketing pharmacovigilance have been primarily qualitative and paper based. We describe the development and implementation of online signal management (OSM), a new systems-based platform for pharmacovigilance that supports prioritization of safety issues, in-stream review and data retrieval, aggregate-level analysis of data patterns, and knowledge management. By providing an integrated view of the information needed to detect and evaluate safety signals, OSM enhances the efficiency of the pharmacovigilance process. The system enables pharmacovigilance professionals to triage incoming data using statistical, visualization, and alerting tools. Safety issues can be flagged and tracked, providing a streamlined approach to the retention and sharing of knowledge. We have deployed OSM to more than 100 users. User surveys and operational metrics demonstrate that OSM increases the efficiency of pharmacovigilance and that users are highly satisfied with OSM and the processes implemented for its use. In summary, this integration of state-of-the-art statistical and visualization tools with traditional, case-evaluation tools and a novel knowledge management system represents a significant advance in pharmacovigilance.",

        "Abstract": "A human operator monitoring a safety-critical system has to perceive information quickly and accurately to detect critical system states and execute countermeasures in time. So far, testing such human machine interfaces (HMIs) is a complex task as HMI design prototypes have to be implemented for simulation environments to perform tests with professional operators. We propose Konect Value, a quantitative method to estimate the relative perception accuracy and operator reaction time at an early design stage. The model-based method solely requires a task model and HMI design sketches as input. To validate the Konect Value, we applied the quantitative measure to seven different HMIs in a truck platooning use case. A comparison of the calculated value to the measured accuracy and reaction times in a lab study (n=33) revealed high correlations for the relative reaction time (r=0.83, p<0.05) and relative perception accuracy (r=-0.90, p<0.01). This indicates that Konect Value is a promising method for early HMI design evaluation in the safety-critical system domain.",

They process documents without differentiating the manifold aspects of information. Spatial and temporal dimensions are particularly dismissed. These dimensions are, however, of great interest for users of search engines targeting either the Web or specialized Digital Libraries. Recent studies reported that nearly 20% queries convey spatial and temporal information in addition to topical information. These three dimensions were referred to as parts of 'geographic information.' In the literature, search engines handling those dimensions are called 'Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) systems.' Although several initiatives for evaluating GIR systems were undertaken, none was concerned with evaluating these three dimensions altogether. In this article, we address this issue by designing an evaluation framework, usefulness of which is highlighted through a case study involving a test collection and a GIR system. This framework allowed the comparison of our GIR system to state-of-the-art topical approaches. We also performed experiments for measuring performance improvement stemming from each dimension or their combination. We show that combining the three dimensions yields improvement in effectiveness (+73.9%) over a common topical baseline. Moreover, rather than conveying redundancy, the three dimensions complement each other.",

        "Abstract": "The mobile ecosystem is characterized by a large and complex network of companies interacting with each other, directly and indirectly, to provide a broad array of mobile products and services to end-customers. With the convergence of enabling technologies, the complexity of the mobile ecosystem is increasing multifold as new actors are emerging, new relations are formed, and the traditional distribution of power is shifted. Drawing on theories of network science, complex systems, interfirm relationships, and the creative art and science of visualization, this paper identifies key players and maps the complex structure and dynamics of nearly 7000 global companies and over 18,000 relationships in the converging mobile ecosystem. Our approach enables decision makers to (i) visually explore the complexity of interfirm relations in the mobile ecosystem, (ii) discover the relation between current and emerging segments, (iii) determine the impact of convergence on ecosystem structure, (iv) understand a firm's competitive position, and (v) identify interfirm relation patterns that may influence their choice of innovation strategy or business models.Journal of Information Technology (2009) 24, 144\u2013159. doi:10.1057/jit.2008.34; published online 24 February 2009",

In NPD, patent analysis is an important part of literature review, since the patent documents represent a huge reservoir of most systematic and updated information about any particular technology and product. A systematic search on a trusted global patent database with proper analytical tools could be used as powerful R&D tool to not only identify the state-of-art but also to extract leads to solution for critical R&D problems. Therefore, a focused search on professional patent database was performed to extract most relevant patent documents for R&D work related to the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) decontamination device. Semantic keyword search and IPC based search followed by a thorough screening and analysis of the searched documents resulted in useful patent documents. These patent documents disclosed various aspects related to CBRN decontamination device which helped in the design & development of a novel CBRN Decon device.",

Target audience This review targets pathologists and informaticians who have a limited understanding of the key aspects of whole-slide image (WSI) analysis and/or a limited knowledge of state-of-the-art technologies and analysis methods. Scope First, we discuss the importance of imaging informatics in pathology and highlight the challenges posed by histopathological WSI. Next, we provide a thorough review of current methods for: quality control of histopathological images; feature extraction that captures image properties at the pixel, object, and semantic levels; predictive modeling that utilizes image features for diagnostic or prognostic applications; and data and information visualization that explores WSI for de novo discovery. In addition, we highlight future research directions and discuss the impact of large public repositories of histopathological data, such as the Cancer Genome Atlas, on the field of pathology informatics. Following the review, we present a case study to illustrate a clinical decision support system that begins with quality control and ends with predictive modeling for several cancer endpoints. Currently, state-of-the-art software tools only provide limited image processing capabilities instead of complete data analysis for clinical decision-making. We aim to inspire researchers to conduct more research in pathology imaging informatics so that clinical decision support can become a reality.",

Highly cited papers serve as a proxy for 'excellence' and coauthored papers as a measure of collaborative efforts. We find that currently research institutes (of the Russian Academy of Sciences as well as others) remain the key players despite recent government initiatives to stimulate university science. The contribution of the commercial sector to high-impact research is negligible. More than 90% of Russian highly cited papers involve international collaboration, and Russian institutions often do not play a dominant role. Partnership with U.S., German, U.K., and French scientists increases markedly the probability of a Russian paper becoming highly cited. Patterns of national ('intranational') collaboration in world-class research differ significantly across different types of organizations; the strongest ties are between three nuclear/particle physics centers. Finally, we draw a coauthorship map to visualize collaboration between Russian centers of excellence.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>As one of the most essential technical components of the intensive care unit (ICU), continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters has significantly improved patient safety by alerting staff through an alarm when a parameter deviates from the normal range. However, the vast number of alarms regularly overwhelms staff and may induce alarm fatigue, a condition recently exacerbated by COVID-19 and potentially endangering patients.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study focused on providing a complete and repeatable analysis of the alarm data of an ICU's patient monitoring system. We aimed to develop do-it-yourself (DIY) instructions for technically versed ICU staff to analyze their monitoring data themselves, which is an essential element for developing efficient and effective alarm optimization strategies.<bold>Methods: </bold>This observational study was conducted using alarm log data extracted from the patient monitoring system of a 21-bed surgical ICU in 2019. DIY instructions were iteratively developed in informal interdisciplinary team meetings. The data analysis was grounded in a framework consisting of 5 dimensions, each with specific metrics: alarm load (eg, alarms per bed per day, alarm flood conditions, alarm per device and per criticality), avoidable alarms, (eg, the number of technical alarms), responsiveness and alarm handling (eg alarm duration), sensing (eg, usage of the alarm pause function), and exposure (eg, alarms per room type). Results were visualized using the R package ggplot2 to provide detailed insights into the ICU's alarm situation.<bold>Results: </bold>We developed 6 DIY instructions that should be followed iteratively step by step. Alarm load metrics should be (re)defined before alarm log data are collected and analyzed. Intuitive visualizations of the alarm metrics should be created next and presented to staff in order to help identify patterns in the alarm data for designing and implementing effective alarm management interventions. We provide the script we used for the data preparation and an R-Markdown file to create comprehensive alarm reports. The alarm load in the respective ICU was quantified by 152.5 (SD 42.2) alarms per bed per day on average and alarm flood conditions with, on average, 69.55 (SD 31.12) per day that both occurred mostly in the morning shifts. Most alarms were issued by the ventilator, invasive blood pressure device, and electrocardiogram (ie, high and low blood pressure, high respiratory rate, low heart rate). The exposure to alarms per bed per day was higher in single rooms (26%, mean 172.9/137.2 alarms per day per bed).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Analyzing ICU alarm log data provides valuable insights into the current alarm situation. Our results call for alarm management interventions that effectively reduce the number of alarms in order to ensure patient safety and ICU staff's work satisfaction. We hope our DIY instructions encourage others to follow suit in analyzing and publishing their ICU alarm data.",

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is largely based on review of literature both online and print. Findings - The paper concludes that the paradigm shifts occurring in the information environment have affected the concept of library; the perception of ownership versus access of library resources; the nature of information resources and services; and the role of the information professional among others. Research limitations/implications - The paper advocates for a proactive strategy on the part of information professionals in order to re-engineer and adapt the library to the volatile global information environment in order to remain relevant in the wake of new paradigm occurrences. Practical implications - Effective access and use of information will inevitably have great influence on the realisation of positive effects that the new paradigms occurrences engender in the global environment. It is desirable at this point in time to research into how information access and use can be brought to bear on the attainment of MDGs, bridge digital divide, enhance attainment of information society, promote e-govemment, etc. Originality/value - Despite, the rapid changes within the global information environment that has been occasioned by ICT, there is lack of critical mass of information science literature that addresses issues such MDGs, globalisation, information society and digital divide from the perspective of the information professional.",

        "Abstract": "This paper reconsiders common benchmarking approaches to nearest neighbor search. It is shown that the concepts of local intrinsic dimensionality (LID), local relative contrast (RC), and query expansion allow to choose query sets of a wide range of difficulty for real-world datasets. Moreover, the effect of the distribution of these dimensionality measures on the running time performance of implementations is empirically studied. To this end, different visualization concepts are introduced that allow to get a more fine-grained overview of the inner workings of nearest neighbor search principles. Interactive visualizations are available on the companion website. 1 1 https://cecca.github.io/role-of-dimensionality/. The paper closes with remarks about the diversity of datasets commonly used for nearest neighbor search benchmarking. It is shown that such real-world datasets are not diverse: results on a single dataset predict results on all other datasets well. \u2022 Local dimensionality measures allow to build query sets of different degrees of difficulty. \u2022 Local Intrinsic Dimensionality is the most effective at selecting queries. \u2022 Using average performance measures hides interesting behavior of algorithms. \u2022 Datasets commonly used as benchmarks are not diverse enough.",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The high-dimensional visualisation approach was applied to three science topics to test its effectiveness for longitudinal analysis of message framing on Twitter over two disjoint periods in time. The paper uses coding frames to drive categorisation and visual analytics of tweets discussing the science topics. Findings \u2013 The findings point to the potential of this mixed methods approach, as it allows sufficiently high sensitivity to recognise and support the analysis of non-trending as well as trending topics on Twitter. Research limitations/implications \u2013 Three topics are studied, these illustrate a range of frames, but results may not be representative of all science topics. Social implications \u2013 Funding bodies increasingly encourage scientists to participate in public engagement. As social media provides an avenue actively utilised for public communication, understanding the nature of the dialog on this medium is important for the scientific community and the public at large. Originality/value \u2013 This study differs from standard approaches to the analysis of micropost data, which tend to focus on large-scale data sets. It provides evidence that this approach enables practical and effective analysis of the content of midsize to large collections of microposts.",

        "Abstract": "While literature reviews with a large-scale scope are nowadays becoming a staple element of modern research practice, there are many challenges in taking on such an endeavour, yet little evidence of previous studies addressing these challenges exists. This paper introduces a practical and efficient review framework for extremely large corpora of literature, refined by five parallel implementations within a multi-disciplinary project aiming to map out the research and practice landscape of modelling, simulation, and management methods, spanning a variety of sectors of application where such methods have made a significant impact. Centred on searching and screening techniques along with the use of some emerging IT-assisted analytic and visualisation tools, the proposed framework consists of four key methodological elements to deal with the scale of the reviews, namely: (a) an incremental and iterative review structure, (b) a 3-stage screening phase including filtering, sampling and sifting, (c) use of visualisation tools, and (d) reference chasing (both forward and backward). Five parallel implementations of systematically conducted literature search and screening yielded a total initial search result of 146 087 papers, ultimately narrowed down to a final set of 1383 papers which was manageable within the limited time and other constraints of this research work.",

        "Abstract": "The increasing amount of valuable, unstructured textual information poses a major challenge to extract value from those texts. We need to use NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques, most of which rely on manually annotating a large corpus of text for its development and evaluation. Creating a large annotated corpus is laborious and requires suitable computational support. There are many annotation tools available, but their main weaknesses are the absence of data management features for quality control and the need for a commercial license. As the quality of the data used to train an NLP model directly affects the quality of the results, the quality control of the annotations is essential. In this paper, we introduce ERAS, a novel web-based text annotation tool developed to facilitate and manage the process of text annotation. ERAS includes not only the key features of current mainstream annotation systems but also other features necessary to improve the curation process, such as the inter-annotator agreement, self-agreement and annotation log visualization, for annotation quality control. ERAS also implements a series of features to improve the customization of the user's annotation workflow, such as: random document selection, re-annotation stages, and warm-up annotations. We conducted two empirical studies to evaluate the tool's support to text annotation, and the results suggest that the tool not only meets the basic needs of the annotation task but also has some important advantages over the other tools evaluated in the studies. ERAS is freely available at https://github.com/grosmanjs/eras. \u2022 We propose ERAS: A new text annotation/curation tool for NLP tasks. \u2022 The ERAS is an ontology-based annotation tool for entities and relations labeling. \u2022 To improve the quality control all the actions made by the annotators are logged. \u2022 In our studies, the ERAS improved upon several aspects when compared to other tools.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Until recently, laboratory automation has focused primarily on improving hardware. Future advances are concentrated on intelligent software since laboratories performing clinical diagnostic testing require improved information systems to address their data processing needs. In this paper, we propose DB4US, an application that automates information related to laboratory quality indicators information. Currently, there is a lack of ready-to-use management quality measures. This application addresses this deficiency through the extraction, consolidation, statistical analysis, and visualization of data related to the use of demographics, reagents, and turn-around times. The design and implementation issues, as well as the technologies used for the implementation of this system, are discussed in this paper. Objective: To develop a general methodology that integrates the computation of ready-to-use management quality measures and a dashboard to easily analyze the overall performance of a laboratory, as well as automatically detect anomalies or errors. The novelty of our approach lies in the application of integrated web-based dashboards as an information management system in hospital laboratories. Methods: We propose a new methodology for laboratory information management based on the extraction, consolidation, statistical analysis, and visualization of data related to demographics, reagents, and turn-around times, offering a dashboard-like user web interface to the laboratory manager. The methodology comprises a unified data warehouse that stores and consolidates multidimensional data from different data sources. The methodology is illustrated through the implementation and validation of DB4US, a novel web application based on this methodology that constructs an interface to obtain ready-to-use indicators, and offers the possibility to drill down from high-level metrics to more detailed summaries. The offered indicators are calculated beforehand so that they are ready to use when the user needs them. The design is based on a set of different parallel processes to precalculate indicators. The application displays information related to tests, requests, samples, and turn-around times. The dashboard is designed to show the set of indicators on a single screen. Results: DB4US was deployed for the first time in the Hospital Costa del Sol in 2008. In our evaluation we show the positive impact of this methodology for laboratory professionals, since the use of our application has reduced the time needed for the elaboration of the different statistical indicators and has also provided information that has been used to optimize the usage of laboratory resources by the discovery of anomalies in the indicators. DB4US users benefit from Internet-based communication of results, since this information is available from any computer without having to install any additional software. Conclusions: The proposed methodology and the accompanying web application,",

The need for assistance in performing urban planning tasks has led to the rapid development of urban information systems, especially \u201ce-Planning\u201d systems, with the support of government policy and emerging information and communication technologies (ICT). In order to enhance the capability of e-Planning and to facilitate 3D visualization and rich analysis of complex city problems, it is very important to allow information from the various sources to be shared and integrated. This paper focuses on technical approaches for multidimensional information integration, especially spatial information integration. In particular it describes the Building Data Integration System (BDIS), developed as part of the IntelCities project, which demonstrates the type of multidimensional systems that are likely to be used in future urban information systems. Functionally, the BDIS demonstrates the feasibility of systems to support the multinational collaboration of construction professionals in the procurement and renovation of buildings. For such systems to be accepted in the United Kingdom (UK) and Europe, they need to be developed with regard to current planning information structures and standards in the UK and Europe which are reviewed in this paper. The achievements and further development of multidimensional information integration through the use of innovative urban data modelling techniques are discussed.",

Recent developments in multidimensional scaling (MDS) enable us to distinguish the stress originating in each time-slice from the stress originating from the sequencing of time-slices, and thus to locally optimize the trade-offs between these two sources of variance in the animation. Furthermore, visualization programs like Pajek and Visone allow us to show not only the positions of the nodes, but also their relational attributes such as betweenness centrality. Betweenness centrality in the vector space can be considered as an indicator of interdisciplinarity. Using this indicator, the dynamics of the citation-impact environments of the journals Cognitive Science, Social Networks, and Nanotechnology are animated and assessed in terms of interdisciplinarity among the disciplines involved.",

Since many clustering methods operate on the similarities between documents, it is important to build representations of these documents which keep their semantics as much as possible and are also suitable for efficient similarity calculation. As we describe in Koopman et al. (Proceedings of ISSI 2015 Istanbul: 15th International Society of Scientometrics and Informetrics Conference, Istanbul, Turkey, 29 June to 3 July, 2015. Bogazi\u00e7i University Printhouse. , 2015), the metadata of articles in the Astro dataset contribute to a semantic matrix, which uses a vector space to capture the semantics of entities derived from these articles and consequently supports the contextual exploration of these entities in LittleAriadne. However, this semantic matrix does not allow to calculate similarities between articles directly. In this paper, we will describe in detail how we build a semantic representation for an article from the entities that are associated with it. Base on such semantic representations of articles, we apply two standard clustering methods, K-Means and the Louvain community detection algorithm, which leads to our two clustering solutions labelled as OCLC-31 (standing for K-Means) and OCLC-Louvain (standing for Louvain). In this paper, we will give the implementation details and a basic comparison with other clustering solutions that are reported in this special issue.",

        "Abstract": "In the last decade, Europe has conducted a tremendous effort to make cultural, educational and scientific resources publicly available. Although such massive amounts of culturally and scientifically rich content are available, the potential of its use for educational and scientific purposes remains largely untapped. One reason can be seen in current web content dissemination mechanism, which are dominated by a small number of large central hubs like major search engines (e.g. Google), social networks (e.g. Facebook) or online encyclopaedias (e.g. Wikipedia). In order to maintain their valuable services, those large hubs have to focus on commercially viable mainstream content. While cultural and scientific resources provide valuable and educational content, they cannot be considered as 'mainstream'. Quite contrary, most of this can be considered as high-quality niche content for a rather small community and forms part of the so-called Long Tail. The Long Tail theory, first introduced by Chris Anderson, argues that in internet-based markets, niche content adds up to a huge body of knowledge, but is hidden from most users. In the Long Tail, content is maintained and curated by a large number of small to medium-sized institutions such as memory organisations (e.g. archives and museums), national and digital libraries and open educational repositories. However, the few large web hubs hardly support the dissemination of this Long Tail content leaving a gap for bringing cultural and scientific wealth into educational and scientific processes. In order to reshape content dissemination mechanisms for highly specialised Long Tail content, EEXCESS introduces the idea on augmenting existing web channels with high quality content through personalised, contextualised and privacy preserving recommendations. In order to communicate the knowledge contained in the content, EEXCESS researches visualisation and interaction techniques for presenting recommendation results. The main underlying concept is to bring the content to the user, i.e. injecting content into channels used by users, instead of bringing the user to the content, i.e. creating additional portals that compete for user attention in the Long Tail.",

        "Abstract": "Co-occurrence matrices, such as cocitation, coword, and colink matrices, have been used widely in the information sciences. However, confusion and controversy have hindered the proper statistical analysis of these data. The underlying problem, in our opinion, involved understanding the nature of various types of matrices. This article discusses the difference between a symmetrical cocitation matrix and an asymmetrical citation matrix as well as the appropriate statistical techniques that can be applied to each of these matrices, respectively. Similarity measures (such as the Pearson correlation coefficient or the cosine) should not be applied to the symmetrical cocitation matrix but can be applied to the asymmetrical citation matrix to derive the proximity matrix. The argument is illustrated with examples. The study then extends the application of co-occurrence matrices to the Web environment, in which the nature of the available data and thus data collection methods are different from those of traditional databases such as the Science Citation Index. A set of data collected with the Google Scholar search engine is analyzed by using both the traditional methods of multivariate analysis and the new visualization software Pajek, which is based on social network analysis and graph theory.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, scientometrics cognitive and knowledge visualization technology were used to evaluate global scientific production and development trends in construction and building technology research of smart cities. All the data was collected from the Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCIE) database and Journal Citation Reports (JCR). The published papers from the subject of construction and building technology and their journals, authors, countries and keywords spanning over several aspects of research topics, proved that architecture/building research grew rapidly over the past 30 years, and the trend still continues in recent smart cities era. The purposed of this study were to identify the journals in the field of construction and building technology in smart city, make a comparative report on related researches, as well as propose a quality evaluation of those journals. Based on JCR and SCI paper data, the journals related to construction and building technology in smart city were assessed using ten metrics: languages, active degree, references, citation trends, main countries, leading institutes, cooperation trends, productive authors, author keywords and keywords plus. The results indicate that all the factors have great significance and are related to the impact of a journal. It also provides guidance to both evaluators and the study groups which assess journals during the process of judging or selecting research outlets, and future perspective on how to improve the impact of a paper or a journal.",

Although the list-based representation makes it easy to evaluate a single document for relevance, it does not support the users in the broader tasks of manipulating or exploring the search results as they attempt to find a collection of relevant documents. HotMap is a meta-search system that provides a compact visual representation of Web search results at two levels of detail, and it supports interactive exploration via nested sorting of Web search results based on query term frequencies. An evaluation of the search results for a set of vague queries has shown that the re-sorted search results can provide a higher portion of relevant documents among the top search results. User studies show an increase in speed and effectiveness and a reduction in missed documents when comparing HotMap to the list-based representation used by Google. Subjective measures were positive, and users showed a preference for the HotMap interface. These results provide evidence for the utility of next-generation Web search results interfaces that promote interactive search results exploration.",

        "Abstract": "Mapping the knowledge structure from word co-occurrences in a collection of academic papers has been widely used to provide insight into the topic evolution in an arbitrary research field. In a traditional approach, the paper collection is first divided into temporal subsets, and then a co-word network is independently depicted in a 2D map to characterize each period's trend. To effectively map emerging research trends from such a time-series of co-word networks, this paper presents TrendNets, a novel visualization methodology that highlights the rapid changes in edge weights over time. Specifically, we formulated a new convex optimization framework that decomposes the matrix constructed from dynamic co-word networks into a smooth part and a sparse part: the former represents stationary research topics, while the latter corresponds to bursty research topics. Simulation results on synthetic data demonstrated that our matrix decomposition approach achieved the best burst detection performance over four baseline methods. In experiments conducted using papers published in the past 16 years at three conferences in different fields, we showed the effectiveness of TrendNets compared to the traditional co-word representation. We have made our codes available on the Web to encourage scientific mapping in all research fields.",

We here illustrate how scientific workflows and the Taverna workbench in particular can be used in bibliometrics. We discuss the specific capabilities of Taverna that makes this software a powerful tool in this field, such as automated data import via Web services, data extraction from XML by XPaths, and statistical analysis and visualization with R. The support of the latter is particularly relevant, as it allows integration of a number of recently developed R packages specifically for bibliometrics.

However, as wikis are increasingly adopted in settings such as business, government, and education, where editors are largely driven by career goals, there is a perceived need to modify wikis so that each editor's contributions are clearly presented. In this paper we introduce an approach for assessing the contributions of wiki editors along several authorship categories, as well as a variety of information glyphs for visualizing this information. We report on three types of analysis: (a) assessing the accuracy of the algorithms, (b) estimating the understandability of the visualizations, and (c) exploring wiki editors' perceptions regarding the extent to which such an approach is likely to change their behavior. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed automated techniques can estimate fairly accurately the quantity of editors' contributions across various authorship categories, and that the visualizations we introduced can clearly convey this information to users. Moreover, our user study suggests that such tools are likely to change wiki editors' behavior. We discuss both the potential benefits and risks associated with solutions for estimating and visualizing wiki contributions.",

As of the date of this analysis, it had claimed about 2 million lives worldwide, and the number is rising sharply. Governments, societies, and scientists are equally challenged under this burden. Objective: This study aimed to map global coronavirus research in 2020 according to various influencing factors to highlight incentives or necessities for further research. Methods: The application of established and advanced bibliometric methods combined with the visualization technique of density-equalizing mapping provided a global picture of incentives and efforts on coronavirus research in 2020. Countries' funding patterns and their epidemiological and socioeconomic characteristics as well as their publication performance data were included. Results: Research output exploded in 2020 with momentum, including citation and networking parameters. China and the United States were the countries with the highest publication performance. Globally, however, publication output correlated significantly with COVID-19 cases. Research funding has also increased immensely. Conclusions: Nonetheless, the abrupt decline in publication efforts following previous coronavirus epidemics should demonstrate to global researchers that they should not lose interest even after containment, as the next epidemiological challenge is certain to come. Validated reporting worldwide and the inclusion of low-income countries are additionally important for a successful future research strategy. J Med Internet Res 2021;23(9):e30692 doi:10.2196/30692",

Despite several efforts in the development of automatic methods for measuring credibility in news stories, there has been little previous work focusing on providing explanations that go beyond a black-box decision or score. In this work, we use two machine learning approaches for computing a credibility score for any given news story: one is a linear method trained on stylometric features and the other one is a recurrent neural network. Our goal is to study whether we can explain the rationale behind these automatic methods and improve a reader's confidence in their credibility assessment. Therefore, we first adapted the classifiers to the constraints of a browser extension so that the text can be analysed while browsing online news. We also propose a set of interactive visualisations to explain to the user the rationale behind the automatic credibility assessment. We evaluated our adapted methods by means of standard machine learning performance metrics and through two user studies. The adapted neural classifier showed better performance on the test data than the stylometric classifier, despite the latter appearing to be easier to interpret by the participants. Also, users were significantly more accurate in their assessment after they interacted with the tool as well as more confident with their decisions. \u2022 Web browser extension for online news credibility assessment. \u2022 A visual interface for enhanced understanding of methods' inner workings. \u2022 Deep learning classifier compressed for deployment in a web browser. \u2022 Users more accurate in fake news detection when supported by the tool. \u2022 Model interpretability more important than accuracy in user studies.",

Both the self-organizing map (SOM) method and component plane analysis method were used to investigate associations among the two groups of medical subjects respectively based on browsing activities. The subjects from a health subject directory were extracted and path data among these subjects were analyzed from a consumer health portal transaction log. Two focus themes were selected and two related subject clusters were identified respectively in the SOM display. The association judgements about the subjects related to a specified subject were made in the contexts of the subject component planes. Terms related to the two focus subjects (nerve and heart) and the degree to which these terms were related to the two focus subjects were identified in the study. This study shows that users' navigating activities on the health-related directory can reveal and identify the associations among the subjects on the directory, and the component analysis is reliable when it is applied to identify the subject relationships in such a situation. The findings of this study can be used to enrich medical thesauri, to optimize the medical subject directories, and to understand users' medical information-seeking behaviour.",

        "Abstract": "Objective The rapidly growing volume of multimodal electrophysiological signal data is playing a critical role in patient care and clinical research across multiple disease domains, such as epilepsy and sleep medicine. To facilitate secondary use of these data, there is an urgent need to develop novel algorithms and informatics approaches using new cloud computing technologies as well as ontologies for collaborative multicenter studies. Materials and methods We present the Cloudwave platform, which (a) defines parallelized algorithms for computing cardiac measures using the MapReduce parallel programming framework, (b) supports real-time interaction with large volumes of electrophysiological signals, and (c) features signal visualization and querying functionalities using an ontology-driven web-based interface. Cloudwave is currently used in the multicenter National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS)-funded Prevention and Risk Identification of SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy) Mortality (PRISM) project to identify risk factors for sudden death in epilepsy. Results Comparative evaluations of Cloudwave with traditional desktop approaches to compute cardiac measures (eg, QRS complexes, RR intervals, and instantaneous heart rate) on epilepsy patient data show one order of magnitude improvement for single-channel ECG data and 20 times improvement for four-channel ECG data. This enables Cloudwave to support real-time user interaction with signal data, which is semantically annotated with a novel epilepsy and seizure ontology. Discussion Data privacy is a critical issue in using cloud infrastructure, and cloud platforms, such as Amazon Web Services, offer features to support Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards. Conclusion The Cloudwave platform is a new approach to leverage of large-scale electrophysiological data for advancing multicenter clinical research.",

        "Abstract": "This paper proposes a novel methodology to visualize a classification scheme. It is demonstrated with the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Computing Classification System (CCS). The collection derived from the ACM digital library, containing 37,543 documents classified by CCS. The assigned classes, subject descriptors, and keywords were processed in a dataset to produce a graphical representation of the documents. The general conception is based on the similarity of co-classes (themes) proportional to the number of common publications. The final number of all possible classes and subclasses in the collection was 353 and therefore the similarity matrix of co-classes had the same dimension. A spherical surface was chosen as the target information space. Classes and documents' node locations on the sphere were obtained by means of Multidimensional Scaling coordinates. By representing the surface on a plane like a map projection, it is possible to analyze the visualization layout. The graphical patterns were organized in some colour clusters. For evaluation of given visualization maps, graphics filtering was applied. This proposed method can be very useful in interdisciplinary research fields. It allows for a great amount of heterogeneous information to be conveyed in a compact display, including topics, relationships among topics, frequency of occurrence, importance and changes of these properties over time.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Objective -- The authors sought to determine whether existing definitions of assessment agree with assessment-related skills sought in job postings, and to identify key assessment- related skills, needs for training, and trends in assessment. Design -- Content analysis. Setting -- Job postings from six library-specific websites: the American Library Association, the Library & Information Technology Association, the Society of American Archivists, the Council on Library and Information Resources, the Association of Research Libraries, and Library Assessment job announcements at http://libraryassessment.info/?cat=13. Subjects -- Job titles and descriptions published during an 18-month period between Summer 2012 and Winter 2013 that met the inclusion criteria (n=231). Methods -- Job postings were searched and analyzed in two separate sets whose inclusion criteria is as follows: First, job postings with the term assessment in the position title or as the main focus of the position (n=44) were retrieved; of these, three postings were too old to contain descriptions, so were excluded from analysis. Second, job postings were retrieved with the terms assessment, evaluation, metrics, and strategic in the descriptive text of postings with position titles that did not specifically mention assessment (n=187). The full text of both sets was downloaded to ATLAS.ti software for analysis using a grounded theory approach. Mutually exclusive terms emerging from the coding process were documented and defined; from this analysis, networks of code \"families\" or co-relational groupings helped to create categories and sub-categories. The context of terms was closely examined to understand the meaning of assessment-related terms in job descriptions. Following this step, Microsoft Excel was used to generate tables and pivot tables, aiding understanding and illustrating data. Main Results -- All 44 job posts containing the term assessment as part of the position title were from research universities or four year colleges; of these, most were ARL member libraries. For these postings, the concept of assessment was more clearly aligned with definitions of assessment as an ongoing process. The positions described, requiring a minimum of three years' of experience, ranged from entry-level to administrative in nature. In the second set (187 postings), the interchangeable use of the terms \"assessment\" and \"evaluation\" was particularly evident in job postings unrelated to library instruction. No library types other than academic were recruiting for assessment librarians, but related skills, usually referred to as evaluation in public and special libraries, were mentioned in all areas of library practice including instruction, administration, public services, user behavior, and to a lesser extent, access services, archives, information technology, cataloging, and more. While less prominent, these less often mentioned areas of practice also appear to be increasing their awareness of assessment. Key skills and knowledge areas needed for assessment in libraries emerged from content analysis of the job postings. These were grouped under eight main areas of competency and were augmented by the authors' own experiences as assessment librarians: background in library assessment, research methods, statistical and analytic skills, visualization and presentation skills, and project management and people skills. Conclusions -- Based upon analysis of this set of documents, a culture of assessment in libraries appears to be emerging, demonstrating a possible upward trend when contrasted with the earlier research of Walter and Oakleaf (2010). Overall, assessment related skills and knowledge were increasingly evident across all library types and positions. Suggestions for aiding the development of an emerging culture of assessment include fostering liaisons between ALA divisions and library schools to persuade the schools of the need for related coursework, workshops focused on assessment-related skills, certification programs, and a proposed minor in library assessment. Opening avenues for discussion between library types could enhance the growth of an assessment culture beyond academic librarianship. Additional research to better understand the diffusion of assessment culture and practice into non-academic libraries is also recommended.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the knowledge infrastructure of methodological research on partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) from a network point of view. The analysis involves the structures of authors, institutions, countries and co-citation networks, and discloses trending developments in the field. Design/methodology/approach: Based on bibliometric data downloaded from the Web of Science, the authors apply various social network analysis (SNA) and visualization tools to examine the structure of knowledge networks of the PLS-SEM domain. Specifically, the authors investigate the PLS-SEM knowledge network by analyzing 84 methodological studies published in 39 journals by 145 authors from 106 institutions. Findings: The analysis reveals that specific authors dominate the network, whereas most authors work in isolated groups, loosely connected to the network's focal authors. Besides presenting the results of a country level analysis, the research also identifies journals that play a key role in disseminating knowledge in the network. Finally, a burst detection analysis indicates that method comparisons and extensions, for example, to estimate common factor model data or to leverage PLS-SEM's predictive capabilities, feature prominently in recent research. Originality/value: Addressing the limitations of prior systematic literature reviews on the PLS-SEM method, this is the first study to apply SNA to reveal the interrelated structures and properties of PLS-SEM's research domain.",

        "Abstract": "Background: In recent years, people who sought direct-to-consumer genetic testing services have been increasingly confronted with an unprecedented amount of personal genomic information, which influences their decisions, emotional state, and well-being. However, these users of direct-to-consumer genetic services, who vary in their education and interests, frequently have little relevant experience or tools for understanding, reasoning about, and interacting with their personal genomic data. Online interactive techniques can play a central role in making personal genomic data useful for these users. Objective: We sought to (1) identify the needs of diverse users as they make sense of their personal genomic data, (2) consequently develop effective interactive visualizations of genomic trait data to address these users' needs, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of the developed visualizations in facilitating comprehension. Methods: The first two user studies, conducted with 63 volunteers in the Personal Genome Project and with 36 personal genomic users who participated in a design workshop, respectively, employed surveys and interviews to identify the needs and expectations of diverse users. Building on the two initial studies, the third study was conducted with 730 Amazon Mechanical Turk users and employed a controlled experimental design to examine the effectiveness of different design interventions on user comprehension. Results: The first two studies identified searching, comparing, sharing, and organizing data as fundamental to users' understanding of personal genomic data. The third study demonstrated that interactive and visual design interventions could improve the understandability of personal genomic reports for consumers. In particular, results showed that a new interactive bubble chart visualization designed for the study resulted in the highest comprehension scores, as well as the highest perceived comprehension scores. These scores were significantly higher than scores received using the industry standard tabular reports currently used for communicating personal genomic information. Conclusions: Drawing on multiple research methods and populations, the findings of the studies reported in this paper offer deep understanding of users' needs and practices, and demonstrate that interactive online design interventions can improve the understandability of personal genomic reports for consumers. We discuss implications for designers and researchers.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose \u2013 The use of search engines is the most widely acceptable way for information foraging on the net. Their wide use as an information retrieval tool has created the need for their evaluation as a means of improving their performance. This research attempts to record Greek librarians' views on search engines: their performance and characteristics. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A total of 16 librarians were asked to search for a specific topic using eight search engines; four international (google.com, altavista.com, yahoo.com, exalead.com) and four Greek (google.gr (searching only for Greek text), in.gr, robby.gr, find.gr). Eight questionnaires were completed by each participant; one for every search engine. A total of 128 initial searches were performed by the librarians, followed by 86 further searches with changed search terms. The librarians recorded their experiences in retrieving information and evaluated the first 20 results according to the criteria of precision, relevancy of the retrieved records and the way the results were displayed by each search tool. Findings \u2013 Analysis of the results leads to conclusions about librarians' familiarity with search engines and their views on the retrieved information. The results indicated that participants were satisfied by the presentation, the visualization, the quality and value of results and they were very satisfied with the search engines' interfaces. Thus, most retrieved items were relevant and so the degree of precision was satisfactory. Users preferred mainly international search engines rather than Greek search engines. It was evident that most librarians were very satisfied with the performance of the search engines and felt that their queries had been answered successfully. Originality/value \u2013 The paper presents one of the few studies regarding international and Greek search engines and their use by librarians. The study gathered data with regard to the views of Greek librarians on the use of search engines and their characteristics. In addition, it recorded the attitude of librarians to both the search process and subsequent information retrieval, using Greek and international search engines. It compared different search engines and studied parameters like quality, precision, presentation and value of the search results. This research could form the basis of further study of librarians' behavior in the use of search engines for satisfying their information needs and comparison of information retrieval systems.",

Cloud services can be rapidly composed to form on-demand composite service for accomplishing the users' requirements. However, the uncertainty of cloud services has impacted on the correctness and reliability of the composite services. Especially, for unanticipated hardware and software failures, it is very difficult to assure the quality of the composite services. In the complex cloud computing environments, recovery of the composite services from these failures is a challenging issue. The paper first presents a unified fault taxonomy in the three layers of cloud computing and analyze the causes of the faults. The authors then propose a hierarchical recovery mechanism including five different recovery algorithms for various kinds of failures. Finally, through the simulation experiments they validate the proposed approach to be effective and practical.",

An experimental study was conducted to test the proposed methods. The findings show that the clusters identified from the same cells based on path-length-1 outperformed both the clusters from the adjacent cells based on path-length-1 and the clusters from the same cells based on path-length-2 in the visual SOM display. The U-matrix method successfully distinguished the irrelevant subjects situated in the adjacent cells with different colors in the SOM display.

Ontologies play an important role in supporting automated processes to access information and are at the core of new strategies for the development of knowledge-based systems. Yet, developing an ontology is a time-consuming task which often needs an accurate domain expertise to tackle structural and logical difficulties in the definition of concepts as well as conceivable relationships. This work presents an ontology-based retrieval approach, that supports data organization and visualization and provides a friendly navigation model. It exploits the fuzzy extension of the Formal Concept Analysis theory to elicit conceptualizations from datasets and generate a hierarchy-based representation of extracted knowledge. An intuitive graphical interface provides a multi-facets view of the built ontology. Through a transparent query-based retrieval, final users navigate across concepts, relations and population.",

VR provides visualisation and interaction within a virtual world that closely resembles a real world, bringing an immersive study experience. It also has two special features: representational fidelity and immediacy of control. However, only when the technology fits the tasks that users are performing will it be adopted. In addition, technology itself cannot improve learning outcomes; certain learning behaviours, such as reflective thinking, should be prompted first so that learning outcomes can be improved. The research hypotheses derived from this model have empirically been validated using the responses to a survey among 180 users. These responses have been examined through SmartPLS 2.0. Surprisingly, task\u2013technology fit does not moderate the relationship between VR and technology quality and the relationship between VR and technology accessibility. From this study, we can conclude that VR will influence reflective thinking and further indirectly improve perceived learning effectiveness.",

        "Abstract": "Bioinformatics is a fast-growing, diverse research field that has recently gained much public attention. Even though there are several attempts to understand the field of bioinformatics by bibliometric analysis, the proposed approach in this paper is the first attempt at applying text mining techniques to a large set of full-text articles to detect the knowledge structure of the field. To this end, we use PubMed Central full-text articles for bibliometric analysis instead of relying on citation data provided in Web of Science. In particular, we develop text mining routines to build a custom-made citation database as a result of mining full-text. We present several interesting findings in this study. First, the majority of the papers published in the field of bioinformatics are not cited by others (63 % of papers received less than two citations). Second, there is a linear, consistent increase in the number of publications. Particularly year 2003 is the turning point in terms of publication growth. Third, most researches of bioinformatics are driven by USA-based institutes followed by European institutes. Fourth, the results of topic modeling and word co-occurrence analysis reveal that major topics focus more on biological aspects than on computational aspects of bioinformatics. However, the top 10 ranked articles identified by PageRank are more related to computational aspects. Fifth, visualization of author co-citation analysis indicates that researchers in molecular biology or genomics play a key role in connecting sub-disciplines of bioinformatics.",

        "Abstract": "Public Research Organizations and universities are key players in research activities. In Indonesia, publication output of Public Research Organizations is lower than universities whereas they had balanced funding. The Indonesian government has been developing some strategies to improve research output in Indonesia by establishing national research policy and agenda, which encompass national focus research areas and provision of access to online journal databases. This article evaluates the effectiveness of these strategies by analyzing the productivity, trend, and references of PROs publications using bibliometrics and map visualization. The results revealed that Indonesian PROs productivity is low. Only 11% of Indonesian PROs had publications in reputed international journals. Physics was the dominant subject. There was a mismatch between research output and national research focus areas. There were still many research topics, which were determined as priority areas, but not many publications were produced in these areas such as research in transport and defense. The provision of journals strategy had not worked since 80% of the journals cited was unsubscribed. This study could be used to assess the effectiveness of research policy specifically for developing countries where the research budget is limited.",

        "Abstract": "One of the major barriers for the social inclusion of blind persons is the limited access to graphics-based learning resources which are highly vision oriented. This paper presents a cost-effective tool which facilitates comprehension and creation of virtual directed graphs, such as flowcharts, using alternate modalities of audio and touch. It provides a physically accessible virtual spatial workspace and multimodal interface to non-visually represent directed graphs in interactive manner. The concept of spatial query is used to aid exploration and mental visualization through audio and tactile feedback. A unique aspect of the tool, named DiGVis, offers compatible representations of directed graphs for the sighted and non-sighted persons. A study with 28 visually challenged subjects indicates that the tool facilitates comprehension of layout and directional connectivity of elements in a virtual diagram. Further, in a pilot study, blind persons could independently comprehend a virtual flowchart layout and its logical steps. They were also able to create the flowchart data without sighted assistance using DiGVis. A comparison with sighted subjects using DiGVis for similar task demonstrates the effectiveness of the technique for inclusive education.",

Technology Foresight is selected as an example to illustrate the method proposed in this study. A total of 556 author keywords contained in 181 Technology Foresight related papers have been analyzed. European countries, China, India and Brazil are located at the core of Technology Foresight research. Quantitative ways of mapping journal papers are investigated in this study to unveil emerging elements as well as to demonstrate dynamics and visualization of knowledge. The quantitative method provided in this paper shows a possible way of visualizing and evaluating knowledge structure; thus a computerized calculation is possible for potential quantitative applications, e.g. R&D resource allocation, research performance evaluation, science map, etc.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract. In order to get useful information from various kinds of information sources, we first apply a searching process with query statements to retrieve candidate data objects (called a hunting process in this paper) and then apply a browsing process to check the properties of each object in detail by visualizing candidates. In traditional information retrieval systems, the hunting process determines the quality of the result, since there are only a few candidates left for the browsing process. In order to retrieve data from widely distributed digital libraries, the browsing process becomes very important, since the properties of data sources arc not known in advance. After getting data from various information sources, a user checks the properties of data in detail using the browsing process. The result can be used to improve the hunting process or for selecting more appropriate visualization parameters. Visualization relationships among data arc very important, but will become too time-consuming if the amount of data in the candidate set is large, for example, over one hundred objects. One of the important problems in handling information retrieval from a digital library is to create efficient and powerful visualization mechanisms for the browsing process. One promising way to solve the visualization problem is to map each candidate data object into a location in three-dimensional (3D) space using a proper distance definition. In this paper, we will introduce the functions and organization of a system having a browsing navigator to achieve an efficient browsing process in 3D information search space. This browsing navigator has the following major functions:  1. Selection of features which determine the distance for visualization, in order to generate a uniform distribution of candidate data objects in the resulting space.  2. Calculation of the location of the...",

Their visualization often relies on reducing the dimensions of the information space to create a lower-dimensional feature space which, from the point-of-view of the end user, will be viewed and interpreted as a perceptual space. Critically for information visualization, the degree to which the feature and perceptual spaces correspond is still an open research question. In this paper we report the results of three studies which indicate that distance (or dissimilarity) matrices based on low-level visual features, in conjunction with various similarity measures commonly used in current CBIR systems, correlate with human similarity judgments.",

Design/methodology/approach \u2014 The paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for thesaurus construction and maintenance combining shallow NLP with a clustering algorithm and an information visualization interface. The resulting system TermWatch, extracts terms from a text collection, mines semantic relations between them using complementary linguistic approaches and clusters terms using these semantic relations. The clusters are mapped onto a 2D using an integrated visualization tool. Findings \u2014 The clusters formed exhibit the different relations necessary to populate a thesaurus or ontology: synonymy, generic/specific and relatedness. The clusters represent, for a given term, its closest neighbours in terms of semantic relations. Practical implications \u2014 This could change the way in which information professionals (librarians and documentalists) undertake knowledge organization tasks. TermWatch can be useful either as a starting point for grasping the conceptual organization of knowledge in a huge text collection without having to read the texts, then actually serving as a suggestive tool for populating different hierarchies of a thesaurus or an ontology because its clusters are based on semantic relations. Originality/value \u2014 This lies in several points: combined use of linguistic relations with an adapted clustering algorithm, which is scalable and can handle sparse data. The paper proposes a comprehensive approach to semantic relations acquisition whereas existing studies often use one or two approaches. The domain knowledge maps produced by the system represents an added advantage over existing approaches to automatic thesaurus construction in that clusters are formed using semantic relations between domain terms. Thus while offering a meaningful synthesis of the information contained in the original corpus through clustering, the results can be used for knowledge organization tasks (thesaurus building and ontology population) The system also constitutes a platform for performing several knowledge-oriented tasks like science and technology watch, textmining, query refinement.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>On January 1, 2019, a new regulation on the control of smoking in public places was officially implemented in Hangzhou, China. On the day of the implementation, a large number of Chinese media reported the contents of the regulation on the microblog platform Weibo, causing a strong response from and heated discussion among netizens.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aimed to conduct a content and network analysis to examine topics and patterns in the social media response to the new regulation.<bold>Methods: </bold>We analyzed all microblogs on Weibo that mentioned and explained the regulation in the first 8 days following the implementation. We conducted a content analysis on these microblogs and used social network visualization and descriptive statistics to identify key users and key microblogs.<bold>Results: </bold>Of 7924 microblogs, 12.85% (1018/7924) were in support of the smoking control regulation, 84.12% (6666/7924) were neutral, and 1.31% (104/7924) were opposed to the smoking regulation control. For the negative posts, the public had doubts about the intentions of the policy, its implementation, and the regulations on electronic cigarettes. In addition, 1.72% (136/7924) were irrelevant to the smoking regulation control. Among the 1043 users who explicitly expressed their positive or negative attitude toward the policy, a large proportion of users showed supportive attitudes (956/1043, 91.66%). A total of 5 topics and 11 subtopics were identified.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This study used a content and network analysis to examine topics and patterns in the social media response to the new smoking regulation. We found that the number of posts with a positive attitude toward the regulation was considerably higher than that of the posts with a negative attitude toward the regulation. Our findings may assist public health policy makers to better understand the policy's intentions, scope, and potential effects on public interest and support evidence-based public health regulations in the future.",

Then, a coding scheme focusing on image collections' creation, organization, access and use is developed. Next, three major benchmark image collections are analysed based on the proposed coding scheme. Finally, the characteristics of benchmark image collections are summarized and compared to DLs. Findings: Although most of the image collections in DLs are carefully curated and organized using various metadata schema based on an image's external features to facilitate human use, the benchmark image collections created for promoting image processing algorithms are annotated on an image's content to the pixel level, which makes each image collection a more fine-grained, organized database appropriate for developing automatic techniques on classification summarization, visualization and content-based retrieval. Research limitations/implications: This paper overviews image collections by their application fields. The three most representative natural image collections in general areas are analysed in detail based on a homemade coding scheme, which could be further extended. Also, domain-specific image collections, such as medical image collections or collections for scientific purposes, are not covered. Practical implications: This paper helps DLs with image collections to understand how benchmark image collections used by current image processing research are created, organized and managed. It informs multiple parties pertinent to image collections to collaborate on building, sustaining, enriching and providing access to image collections. Originality/value: This paper is the first attempt to review and summarize benchmark image collections for DL managers and developers. The collection creation process and image organization used in these benchmark image collections open a new perspective to digital librarians for their future DL collection development.",

        "Abstract": "The goal of this article is to identify and describe one of the primary functions of aesthetic quality in the design of computer interfaces and visualization tools. We suggest that researchers in library and information science, computing science, and humanities computing can derive advantages in visual research by acknowledging -- through their efforts to advance aesthetic quality -- that a significant function of aesthetics in this context is to inspire the user's confidence. This confidence typically serves to create a sense of trust in the interface or tool, and to increase its perceived usability. In turn, this increased trust may result in an increased willingness to engage with the interface, on the basis that it demonstrates an attention to detail that promises to reward increased engagement. In addition to confidence, the aesthetic may also contribute to a heightened degree of satisfaction with having spent time using or investigating the object. In the realm of interface design and visualization research, we propose that these components of the aesthetic function (derived through trust) have implications not only for the quality of interactions, but also for the results of the standard measures of performance and preference.",

        "Abstract": "This research used a cell structure map to visualize technological evolution and showed the developmental trend in a technological field. The basic concept was to organize patents into a map produced by growing cell structures. The map was then disassembled into clusters with similar contexts using the Girvan-Newman algorithm. Next, the continuity between clusters in two snapshots was identified and used as the base for establishing a trajectory in the technology. An analysis of patents in the flaw detection field found that the field was composed of several technological trajectories. Among them, ultrasonic flaw detection, wafer inspection and substrate inspection were relatively larger and more continuing technologies, while infrared thermography defect inspection has been an emerging topic in recent years. It is to be hoped that the map of technology constructed in this research provides insights into the history of technological evolution and helps explain the transition patterns through changes in cluster continuity. This can serve a reference point by experts who attempt to visualize the mapping of technological development or identify the latest focus of attention.",

        "Abstract": "Background The integration and visualization of multimodal datasets is a common challenge in biomedical informatics. Several recent studies of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data have illustrated important relationships between morphology observed in whole-slide images, outcome, and genetic events. The pairing of genomics and rich clinical descriptions with whole-slide imaging provided by TCGA presents a unique opportunity to perform these correlative studies. However, better tools are needed to integrate the vast and disparate data types. Objective To build an integrated web-based platform supporting whole-slide pathology image visualization and data integration. Materials and methods All images and genomic data were directly obtained from the TCGA and National Cancer Institute (NCI) websites. Results The Cancer Digital Slide Archive (CDSA) produced is accessible to the public (http://cancer. digitalslidearchive.net) and currently hosts more than 20 000 whole-slide images from 22 cancer types. Discussion The capabilities of CDSA are demonstrated using TCGA datasets to integrate pathology imaging with associated clinical, genomic and MRI measurements in glioblastomas and can be extended to other tumor types. CDSA also allows URL-based sharing of wholeslide images, and has preliminary support for directly sharing regions of interest and other annotations. Images can also be selected on the basis of other metadata, such as mutational profile, patient age, and other relevant characteristics. Conclusions With the increasing availability of wholeslide scanners, analysis of digitized pathology images will become increasingly important in linking morphologic observations with genomic and clinical endpoints.",

        "Abstract": "Unequal stakeholder engagement is a common pitfall of adoption approaches of learning analytics in higher education leading to lower buy-in and flawed tools that fail to meet the needs of their target groups. With each design decision, we make assumptions on how learners will make sense of the visualisations, but we know very little about how students make sense of dashboard and which aspects influence their sense-making. We investigated how learner goals and self-regulated learning (SRL) skills influence dashboard sense-making following a mixed-methods research methodology: a qualitative pre-study followed-up with an extensive quantitative study with 247 university students. We uncovered three latent variables for sense-making: transparency of design , reference frames and support for action. SRL skills are predictors for how relevant students find these constructs. Learner goals have a significant effect only on the perceived relevance of reference frames. Knowing which factors influence students' sense-making will lead to more inclusive and flexible designs that will cater to the needs of both novice and expert learners. \u2022 Transparency of design, reference frames and support for action were found to support students' sense-making of LA dashboards. \u2022 The higher the overall SRL score, the more relevant the three factors were perceived by learners. \u2022 Learner goals affect how relevant students find reference frames. \u2022 The SRL effect on the perceived relevance of transparency depends on learner goals.",

However, most of these methods do not directly extract key concepts and their semantic relationships from document corpora, which could help better illuminate the conceptual structures within given information. To address this issue, we propose an approach called \u201cClonto\u201d to process a document corpus, identify the key concepts, and automatically generate ontologies based on these concepts for the purpose of conceptualization. For a given document corpus, Clonto applies latent semantic analysis to identify key concepts, allocates documents based on these concepts, and utilizes WordNet to automatically generate a corpus-related ontology. The documents are linked to the ontology through the key concepts. Based on two test collections, the experimental results show that Clonto is able to identify key concepts, and outperforms four other clustering algorithms. Moreover, the ontologies generated by Clonto show significant informative conceptual structures.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Inpatient portals (IPPs) have the potential to increase patient engagement and satisfaction with their health care. An IPP provides a hospitalized patient with similar functions to those found in outpatient portals, including the ability to view vital signs, laboratory results, and medication information; schedule appointments; and communicate with their providers. However, IPPs may offer additional functions such as meal planning, real-time messaging with the inpatient care team, daily schedules, and access to educational materials relevant to their specific condition. In practice, IPPs have been developed as websites and tablet apps, with hospitals providing the required technology as a component of care during the patient's stay.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aimed to describe how inpatients are using IPPs at the first academic medical center to implement a system-wide IPP and document the challenges and choices associated with this analytic process.<bold>Methods: </bold>We analyzed the audit log files of IPP users hospitalized between January 2014 and January 2016. Data regarding the date/time and duration of interactions with each of the MyChart Bedside modules (eg, view lab results or medications and patient schedule) and activities (eg, messaging the provider and viewing educational videos) were captured as part of the system audit logs. The development of a construct to describe the length of time associated with a single coherent use of the tool-which we call a session-provides a foundational unit of analysis. We defined frequency as the number of sessions a patient has during a given provision day. We defined comprehensiveness in terms of the percentage of functions that an individual uses during a given provision day.<bold>Results: </bold>The analytic process presented data challenges such as length of stay and tablet-provisioning factors. This study presents data visualizations to illustrate a series of data-cleaning issues. In the presence of these robust approaches to data cleaning, we present the baseline usage patterns associated with our patient panel. In addition to frequency and comprehensiveness, we present considerations of median data to mitigate the effect of outliers.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Although other studies have published usage data associated with IPPs, most have not explicated the challenges and choices associated with the analytic approach deployed within each study. Our intent in this study was to be somewhat exhaustive in this area, in part, because replicability requires common metrics. Our hope is that future researchers in this area will avail themselves of these perspectives to engage in critical assessment moving forward.",

        "Abstract": "In Sperber and Wilson's relevance theory (RT), the ratio Cognitive Effects/Processing Effort defines the relevance of a communication. The tf*idf formula from information retrieval is used to operationalize this ratio for any item co-occurring with a user-supplied seed term in bibliometric distributions. The tf weight of the item predicts its effect on the user in the context of the seed term, and its idf weight predicts the user's processing effort in relating the item to the seed term. The idf measure, also known as statistical specificity, is shown to have unsuspected applications in quantifying interrelated concepts such as topical and nontopical relevance, levels of user expertise, and levels of authority. A new kind of visualization, the pennant diagram, illustrates these claims. The bibliometric distributions visualized are the works cocited with a seed work (Moby Dick), the authors cocited with a seed author (White HD, for maximum interpretability), and the books and articles cocited with a seed article (S.A. Harter's \u201cPsychological Relevance and Information Science,\u201d which introduced RT to information scientists in 1992). Pennant diagrams use bibliometric data and information retrieval techniques on the system side to mimic a relevance-theoretic model of cognition on the user side. Relevance theory may thus influence the design of new visual information retrieval interfaces. Generally, when information retrieval and bibliometrics are interpreted in light of RT, the implications are rich: A single sociocognitive theory may serve to integrate research on literature-based systems with research on their users, areas now largely separate.",

The visualization scheme consisted of (a) the undergraduate's own visualization of his or her essay topic, drawn by the student on the bottom half of a sheet of paper, and (b) a visualization of the information space (determined by index term counting) on the tophalf of the same page. To test the visualization scheme, students enrolled in a Vietnam War history course were randomly assigned to either the visualization scheme group, who received a high recall search output, or the nonvisualization group, who received a high precision search output. The dependent variable was the mark awarded the essay by the course instructor. There was no significant difference between the mean marks for the two groups. We were pleasantly surprised with this result given the bad reputation of high recall as a practical search strategy. We hypothesize that a more proactive visualization system is needed that takes the student through the process of using the visualization scheme, including steps that induce student cognition about task-subject objectives.",

Despite having access to this information, much of the data remain underutilized in the hydrologic sciences due in part to the time required to access, obtain, and integrate data from different sources. Web services offer a means for sharing hydrologic data more openly by providing a standard protocol for machine-to-machine communication. We have used this new technology to create a machine accessible interface for the National Water Information System (NWIS), an online repository of historical and real-time streamflow, water-quality, and ground water level observations maintained by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). These services provide a middle-layer of abstraction between the NWIS database and hydrologic analysis systems, allowing such analysis systems to proxy the NWIS server for on-demand data access. We intentionally designed the services to be generic and applicable to other hydrologic databases, in order to provide interoperability between disparate data sources. Performance tests showed that, for time series with less than 1000 observations, the web services layer added minimal overhead in terms of data response time, and development of an example client application for time series visualization highlighted some of the benefits and costs of using web services for data access.",

        "Abstract": "Complex cognitive activities, such as analytical reasoning, problem solving, and sense making, are often performed through the mediation of interactive computational tools. Examples include visual analytics, decision support, and educational tools. Through interaction with visual representations of information at the visual interface of these tools, a joint, coordinated cognitive system is formed. This partnership results in a number of relational properties-those depending on both humans and tools-that researchers and designers must be aware of if such tools are to effectively support the performance of complex cognitive activities. This article presents 10 properties of interactive visual representations that are essential and relational and whose values can be adjusted through interaction. By adjusting the values of these properties, better coordination between humans and tools can be effected, leading to higher quality performance of complex cognitive activities. This article examines how the values of these properties affect cognitive processing and visual reasoning and demonstrates the necessity of making their values adjustable-all of which is situated within a broader theoretical framework concerned with human-information interaction in complex cognitive activities. This framework can facilitate systematic research, design, and evaluation in numerous fields including information visualization, health informatics, visual analytics, and educational technology.",

Starting with an information-centric perspective, we use the theoretical lens of information processing, to examine the roles of Twitter affordances during the Occupy movement in solving information problems. Our data is a corpus of tweets from the core actors of the movement, as identified by our extended 1/9/90 rule. Using inferential statistics and network visualization, we show how different Twitter affordances act as mechanisms to resolve information problems in many different ways. Our network visualization shows the ecology of the interactions amongst the core actors, and between the core actors and the public. Our work contributes to the discussion around recent social movements on Twitter and advances the theory of information processing.",

Subjects searched for findings with CIVEs, working either alone, in a collocated dyad using a shared electronic whiteboard, or in a remote dyad using application sharing. Groups answered more questions correctly and took less time with the more transparent CIVE than groups using the less transparent CIVE. We interpret our results to mean that groups have better self-corrective abilities when the system is transparent. We present a stage model to explain the collaborative process of using CIVEs, which accounts for task type, collaborative setting, and system transparency.",

And visualization methods are considered to be proper for representing patent information and its analysis results. However, current visualization methods for patent analysis patent maps have some drawbacks. Therefore, we propose an alternative visualization method in this paper. With colleted keywords from patent documents of a target technology field, we cluster patent documents by the k-Means algorithm. With the clustering results, we form a semantic network of keywords without respect of filing dates. And then we build up a patent map by rearranging each keyword node of the semantic network according to its earliest filing date and frequency in patent documents. Our approach contributes to establishing a patent map which considers both structured and unstructured items of a patent document. Besides, differently from previous visualization methods for patent analysis, ours is based on forming a semantic network of keywords from patent documents. And thereby it visualizes a clear overview of patent information in a more comprehensible way. And as a result of those contributions, it enables us to understand advances of emerging technologies and forecast its trend in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Most classical approaches for two-mode clustering of a data matrix are designed to attain homogeneous row by column clusters (blocks, biclusters), that is, biclusters with a small variation of data values within the blocks. In contrast, this article deals with methods that look for a biclustering with a large interaction between row and column clusters. Thereby an aggregated, condensed representation of the existing interaction structure is obtained, together with corresponding row and column clusters, which both allow a parsimonious visualization and interpretation. In this paper we provide a statistical justification, in terms of a probabilistic model, for a two-mode interaction clustering criterion that has been proposed by Bock (1980). Furthermore, we show that maximization of this criterion is equivalent to minimizing the classical least-squares two-mode partitioning criterion for the double-centered version of the data matrix. The latter implies that the interaction clustering criterion can be optimized by applying classical two-mode partitioning algorithms. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach for the case of an empirical data set from personality psychology and we compare this method with other biclustering approaches where interactions play a role.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Using mobile technology for symptom management and self-care can improve patient-clinician communication and clinical outcomes in patients with cancer. The interactive app Interaktor has been shown to reduce symptom burden during cancer treatment. It includes symptom assessment, an alert system for contact with health care professionals, access to self-care advice, and visualization of symptom history. It is essential to understand how digital interventions operate; one approach is to examine engagement by assessing usage and exploring user experiences. Actual usage in relation to the intended use-adherence-is an essential factor of engagement.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aimed to describe engagement with the Interaktor app among patients with breast or prostate cancer during treatment.<bold>Methods: </bold>Patients from the intervention groups of two separate randomized controlled trials were included: patients with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=74) and patients with locally advanced prostate cancer receiving treatment with radiotherapy (n=75). The patients reported their symptoms daily. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained from baseline questionnaires and medical records. Logged data usage was retrieved from the server and analyzed descriptively and with multiple regression analysis. Telephone interviews were conducted with patients about their perceptions of using the app and analyzed using content analysis.<bold>Results: </bold>The median adherence percentage to daily symptom reporting was 83%. Most patients used the self-care advice and free text message component. Among the patients treated for breast cancer, higher age predicted a higher total number of free text messages sent (P=.04). Among the patients treated for prostate cancer, higher age (P=.01) and higher education level (P=.04), predicted an increase in total views on self-care advice, while higher comorbidity (P=.004) predicted a decrease in total views on self-care advice. Being married or living with a partner predicted a higher adherence to daily symptom reporting (P=.02). Daily symptom reporting created feelings of having continuous contact with health care professionals, being acknowledged, and safe. Being contacted by a nurse after a symptom alert was considered convenient and highly valued. Treatment and time-related aspects influenced engagement. Daily symptom reporting was perceived as particularly meaningful at the beginning of treatment. Requests were made for advice on diet and psychological symptoms, as well as for more comprehensive and detailed information as the patient progressed through treatment.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Patient engagement in the interactive app Interaktor was high. The app promoted patient participation in their care through continuous and convenient contact with health care professionals. The predictive ability of demographic variables differed between patient groups, but higher age and a higher educational level predicted higher usage of specific app functions for both patient groups. Patients' experience of relevance and interactivity influenced their engagement positively.",

Their posts and those from their parents contain critical insights that can be used by patients, physicians, and caregivers to manage IBS symptoms.<bold>Objective: </bold>The aim of this study is to examine the posts from adolescent patients and their parents in a health forum, IBS Group, to better understand the key challenges, concerns, and issues of interest to young patients with IBS and their caregivers.<bold>Methods: </bold>Using topic modeling and social network analysis, in this study, we analyzed all the messages (over 750 topics and 3400 replies) posted on the IBS Group forum from 2010-2019 by adolescents with IBS aged 13-17 years and parents having children with IBS. We first detected 6 major topics in the posts by adolescent patients and parents on teenagers' IBS symptoms and the interaction between the topics. Social network analysis was then performed to gain insights into the nature of web-based interaction patterns among patients and caregivers.<bold>Results: </bold>Using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm and a latent Dirichlet allocation visualization tool, this study revealed 6 leading topics of concern in adolescents with IBS: school life, treatment or diet, symptoms, boys' ties to doctors, social or friend issues, and girls' ties to doctors. The top 6 topics in the parents' discussions were school life, girls' issues, boys' issues, diet choice, symptoms, and stress. The analyses show that the adolescent patients themselves are most concerned about the effect of IBS on their everyday activities and social lives. For parents having daughters with IBS, their top concerns were related to the girls' school performance and how much help they received at school. For their sons, the parents were more concerned about the pain and suffering that their sons had to endure. Both parents and adolescents gained social support from the web-based platform. Topic modeling shows that IBS affects teenagers the most in the areas of pain and school life. Furthermore, the issues raised by parents suggest that girls are bothered more by school performance over pain, whereas boys show exactly the opposite: pain is of greater concern than school performance.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This study represents the first attempt to leverage both machine learning approaches and social network analysis to identify top IBS concerns from the perspectives of adolescent patients and caregivers in the same health forum. Young patients with IBS must face the challenges of social influences and anxiety associated with this health disorder in addition to physical pain and other symptoms. Boys and girls are affected differently by pain and school performance and view the IBS impacts differently from the parents.",

The system fills an important need for text-derived clinical data in translational research such as tissue-banking and clinical trials. The design of caTIES addresses three critical issues for informatics support of translational research: (1) federation of research data sources derived from clinical systems; (2) expressive graphical interfaces for concept-based text mining; and (3) regulatory and security model for supporting multi-center collaborative research. Implementation of the system at several Cancer Centers across the country is creating a potential network of caTIES repositories that could provide millions of de-identified clinical reports to users. The system provides an end-to-end application of medical natural language processing to support multi-institutional translational research programs.",

Visual overviews that show temporal patterns of paper publication and citation links among papers can help researchers and analysts to see the rate of growth of topics, identify key papers, and understand influences across subdisciplines. This article applies a novel network-visualization tool based on meaningful layouts of nodes to present research fronts and show citation links that indicate influences across research fronts. To demonstrate the value of two-dimensional layouts with multiple regions and user control of link visibility, we conducted a design-oriented, preliminary case study with 6 domain experts over a 4-month period. The main benefits were being able (a) to easily identify key papers and see the increasing number of papers within a research front, and (b) to quickly see the strength and direction of influence across related research fronts.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Scholars argued that anti-establishment parties use a populist rhetoric that appeals to the worst instincts of people. Indeed, populist politicians are often viewed as charismatic leaders that have fire in their belly. While in the past these parties heavily relied on anti-establishment platforms and communication rhetoric, their increasing electoral success along with the growing duties linked with government membership transform them into more established parties, rather than pure outsiders, and cast doubts on the feasibility of keeping a populist rhetoric. This paper compares right-wing and non-right-wing populism, investigating whether populist leaders change their rhetorical strategy once in office, decreasing the level of negativity and adopting a more forward-looking and inclusive style of communication, with a stronger focus on fulfilling the policy proposal made during the electoral campaign rather than blaming political rivals. For this purpose, we collected a new corpus of political speeches extracted from video messages posted on Facebook by four anti-establishment party leaders in three countries (Austria, Italy and Spain), from 2016 to 2018, i.e., immediately before and immediately after their access to power. Overall, 30 h of recorded audio from 215 videos (amounting to around 140 million visualizations) have been analyzed using topic models and well-established semantic psycholinguistic dictionaries. The results highlight slight changes in the rhetoric of populist leaders once in power, mostly for non-right-wing populists, as their language becomes less negative, less assertive and more focused on government duties.",

Methods: MeSH terms assigned to 397,475 journal articles published in 2015, as well as their 4,632,992 cited references, were retrieved from Web of Science and MEDLINE databases, respectively, which formed over 7 million MeSH co-assignments and nearly 18 million direct citation pairs. We generated six network visualizations of biomedical science at three levels using Gephi software based on these MeSH co-assignments and citation pairs. Results: The MeSH co-assignment map contained more nodes and edges, as MeSH co-assignments cover all medical topics discussed in articles. By contrast, the MeSH citation map contained fewer but larger nodes and wider edges, as citation links indicate connections to two similar medical topics. Conclusion: These two types of maps emphasize different aspects of biomedical sciences, with MeSH co-assignment maps focusing on the relationship between topics in different categories and MeSH direct citation maps providing insights into relationships between topics in the same or similar category.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: COVID-19, an infectious disease first identified in China, has resulted in an ongoing pandemic all over the world. Most of the countries have been experiencing a difficult period during the fighting of this pandemic. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of privacy concerns and cultural differences on public opinion related to the pandemic. The authors conducted a comparative analysis of public opinion in the US and in China as a case study, in order to determine the results. Design/methodology/approach: National policies on important issues faced during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US and in China were examined through a comparative analysis. The authors used text clustering and visualization to mine public opinion on two popular social media platforms, Twitter and Weibo. From the perspectives of concern for privacy and of national culture, this study combines qualitative and quantitative analysis to discover the acceptance level of national policies by the public in the two countries. Findings: The anti-pandemic policies and measures of the US and China reflect the different characteristics of their respective political systems and national cultures. When considering the culture of the US, it is hard to establish and enforce a rigorous regulation on either mask wearing in public or home quarantine on the national level. The opinions of US people are diverse, regarding national COVID-19 policies, but they are rather unified on privacy issues. On the other hand, Chinese people show a high acceptance of national policies based on their mask-wearing customs and their culture of collectivism. Originality/value: Prior studies have paid insufficient attention to the ways in which user privacy and cultural difference affect public opinion on national policies between the US and China. This case study that compares public opinion on current and topical issues which are closely bound up with public life shows originality, as it innovatively provides a cross-cultural perspective on the research of public opinion dissemination during emergencies by considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",

Hence, even for researchers it becomes harder and harder to keep track of research topics and their progress. In this task, researchers can be supported by automated publication analysis. Yet, many such methods result in uninterpretable, purely numerical representations. As an attempt to support human analysts, we present topic space trajectories, a structure that allows for the comprehensible tracking of research topics. We demonstrate how these trajectories can be interpreted based on eight different analysis approaches. To obtain comprehensible results, we employ non-negative matrix factorization as well as suitable visualization techniques. We show the applicability of our approach on a publication corpus spanning 50 years of machine learning research from 32 publication venues. In addition to a thorough introduction of our method, our focus is on an extensive analysis of the results we achieved. Our novel analysis method may be employed for paper classification, for the prediction of future research topics, and for the recommendation of fitting conferences and journals for submitting unpublished work. An advantage in these applications over previous methods lies in the good interpretability of the results obtained through our methods.",

        "Abstract": "An increasingly data-intensive research environment has highlighted the need for greater research transparency to facilitate integrity and trust in open science and in the conduct of research more widely. The initial findings of faculty researchers' behaviors and practices toward research transparency, using the research data lifecycle as a grounding framework are reported. Four focus group sessions were conducted with faculty researchers in different disciplines, including natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, and different transparency practices were captured using the researchers' own language. Four generic transparency components were identified: action verb , object , task , and stage in the research lifecycle. The inter-relationships between specific transparency components were visualized using network visualizations. The network visualizations suggest that the lifecycle stages of Process/Visualize/Analyze and Publish/Preserve/Archive are key points for transparency, where 'data' play a critical role demonstrated by the multiple node-edge relationships. Based on the findings, a conceptual model, termed the Tasks-Toward-Transparency (T3) Model, was developed. This model may inform researcher practices and support research stakeholders whose role is to articulate and deliver transparency advocacy, policy, training programs, and services. Unlabelled Image \u2022 Network graphs illustrate the relationships between activities supporting transparency across the research lifecycle. \u2022 The lifecycle stages of \"Data Analysis\" and \"Publish\" are key stages for transparency practices. \u2022 The Tasks-Toward-Transparency (T3) Model can be used to inform practice, training, and open science advocacy.",

These 20 maps occur in three basic forms: hierarchical, centric, and noncentric (or circular). The consensus map, generated from consensus edges that occur in at least half of the input maps, emerges in a circular form. The ordering of areas is as follows: mathematics is (arbitrarily) placed at the top of the circle, and is followed clockwise by physics, physical chemistry, engineering, chemistry, earth sciences, biology, biochemistry, infectious diseases, medicine, health services, brain research, psychology, humanities, social sciences, and computer science. The link between computer science and mathematics completes the circle. If the lowest weighted edges are pruned from this consensus circular map, a hierarchical map stretching from mathematics to social sciences results. The circular map of science is found to have a high level of correspondence with the 20 existing maps, and has a variety of advantages over hierarchical and centric forms. A one-dimensional Riemannian version of the consensus map is also proposed.",

Design - Mixed methods consisting of network analysis and semi-structured interviews. Setting - Academics based in the United Kingdom. Subjects - 55 U.K.-based academics who use an academic social networking site and Twitter, of whom 18 were interviewed. Methods - For each subject, ego-networks were collected from Twitter and either ResearchGate or Academia.edu. Twitter data were collected primarily via the Twitter API, and the social networking site data were collected either manually or using a commercial web scraping program. Edge tables were created in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and imported into Gephi for analysis and visualization. A purposive subsample of subjects was interviewed via Skype using a semi-structured format intended to illuminate further the network analysis findings. Transcripts were deductively coded using a grounded theory-based approach. Main Results - Network analysis replicated earlier findings in the literature. A large number of academics have relatively few connections to others in the network, while a small number have relatively many connections. In terms of reciprocity (the proportion of mutual ties or pairings out of all possible pairings that could exist in the network), arts and humanities disciplines were significantly more reciprocal. Communities (measured using the modularity algorithm, which looks at the density of links within and between different subnetworks) are more frequently defined by institutions and research interests on academic social networking sites and by research interests and personal interests on Twitter. The overall picture was reinforced by the qualitative analysis. According to interview participants, academic social networking sites reflect pre-existing professional relationships and do not foreground social interaction, serving instead as a kind of virtual CV. By contrast, Twitter is analogized to a conference coffee break, where users can form new connections.",

        "Abstract": "This article investigates to what extent computer-supported argument visualization can be designed to encourage debate and deliberation by citizens on public issues. Such argument maps use icons and arrows to represent the structure of a series of related viewpoints, reducing the amount of text necessary to convey the ideas, thereby clarifying the issue under consideration. Argument maps have the potential to provide a readily accessible medium by which citizens can follow and join in public debates on policy issues. In this article we describe our approach and the type of maps we have chosen to use and then demonstrate the potential of a collection of maps to form a \"policy memory\" to support policy development. Our case study is the development of the \"smoking in public places\" policy in the Scottish Parliament. Our overall aim is to engage citizens in democratic decision making, leading to better policymaking and a more engaged citizenry.",

The co-classifications among the patents enable us to analyze and visualize the relations among technologies at different levels of aggregation. The hypothesis that classifications might be considered as the organizers of patents into classes, and therefore that co-classification patterns\u2014more than co-citation patterns\u2014might be useful for mapping, is not corroborated. The classifications hang weakly together, even at the four-digit level; at the country level, more specificity can be made visible. However, countries are not the appropriate units of analysis because patent portfolios are largely similar in many advanced countries in terms of the classes attributed. Instead of classes, one may wish to explore the mapping of title words as a better approach to visualize the intellectual organization of patents.",

The fact that patient management in large institutions is handled by complex information systems brings about the need for integration between applications on both sides. The paper describes a prototype for automatic data collection from intensive care devices developed at Pedro Hispano Hospital in Portugal. The system acts as an application gateway between the network of patient monitoring devices and the general-purpose hospital network. The conformance to medical standards is one of the main concerns. The international standard Health Level 7 (HL7) has been adopted to import vital signs, as well as to prepare data for visualization in departmental applications and to organize archives. The design has followed the administrative and clinical processes in the hospital closely, leading to a successful interaction with the health professionals. Automatic acquisition eliminates transcription errors, improves the quality of records and allows the assembly of large electronic archives of vital sign data. The concern with data archiving in standard formats opens many possibilities for further analysis of the collected data sets. The possibility of communicating via the HL7 standard makes the whole system easily interoperable with applications in related domains.",

        "Abstract": "Since the inception of geology as a modern science, paleontologists have described a large number of fossil species. This makes fossilized organisms an important tool in the study of stratigraphy and past environments. Since taxonomic classifications of organisms, and thereby their names, change frequently, the correct application of this tool requires taxonomic expertise in finding correct synonyms for a given species name. Much of this taxonomic information has already been published in journals and books where it is compiled in carefully prepared synonymy lists. Because this information is scattered throughout the paleontological literature, it is difficult to find and sometimes not accessible. Also, taxonomic information in the literature is often difficult to interpret for non-taxonomists looking for taxonomic synonymies as part of their research. The highly formalized structure makes Open Nomenclature synonymy lists ideally suited for computer aided identification of taxonomic synonyms. Because a synonymy list is a list of citations related to a taxon name, its bibliographic nature allows the application of bibliometric techniques to calculate the impact of synonymies and taxonomic concepts. TaxonRank is a ranking algorithm based on bibliometric analysis and Internet page ranking algorithms. TaxonRank uses published synonymy list data stored in TaxonConcept, a taxonomic information system. The basic ranking algorithm has been modified to include a measure of confidence on species identification based on the Open Nomenclature notation used in synonymy list, as well as other synonymy specific criteria. The results of our experiments show that the output of the proposed ranking algorithm gives a good estimate of the impact a published taxonomic concept has on the taxonomic opinions in the geological community. Also, our results show that treating taxonomic synonymies as part of on an ontology is a way to record and manage taxonomic knowledge, and thus contribute to the preservation our scientific heritage.",

        "Abstract": "Development of accurate systems to assess academic research performance is an essential topic in national science agendas around the world. Providing quantitative elements such as scientometric rankings and indicators have contributed to measure prestige and excellence of universities, but more sophisticated computational tools are seldom exploited. We compare the evolution of Mexican scientific production in Scopus and the Web of Science as well as Mexico's scientific productivity in relation to the growth of the National Researchers System of Mexico is analyzed. As a main analysis tool we introduce an artificial intelligence procedure based on self-organizing neural networks. The neural network technique proves to be a worthy scientometric data mining and visualization tool which automatically carries out multiparametric scientometric characterizations of the production profiles of the 50 most productive Mexican Higher Education Institutions (in Scopus database). With this procedure we automatically identify and visually depict clusters of institutions that share similar bibliometric profiles in bidimensional maps. Four perspectives were represented in scientometric maps: productivity, impact, expected visibility and excellence. Since each cluster of institutions represents a bibliometric pattern of institutional performance, the neural network helps locate various bibliometric profiles of academic production, and the identification of groups of institutions which have similar patterns of performance. Also, scientometric maps allow for the identification of atypical behaviors (outliers) which are difficult to identify with classical tools, since they outstand not because of a disparate value in just one variable, but due to an uncommon combination of a set of indicators values.",

        "Abstract": "Bibliometric mapping and visualization techniques represent one of the main pillars in the field of scientometrics. Traditionally, the main methodologies employed for representing data are multidimensional scaling, principal component analysis, or correspondence analysis. In this paper we aim to present a visualization methodology known as biplot analysis for representing bibliometric and science and technology indicators. A biplot is a graphical representation of multivariate data, where the elements of a data matrix are represented according to dots and vectors associated with the rows and columns of the matrix. In this paper, we explore the possibilities of applying biplot analysis in the research policy area. More specifically, we first describe and introduce the reader to this methodology and secondly, we analyze its strengths and weaknesses through 3 different case studies: countries, universities, and scientific fields. For this, we use a biplot analysis known as JK-biplot. Finally, we compare the biplot representation with other multivariate analysis techniques. We conclude that biplot analysis could be a useful technique in scientometrics when studying multivariate data, as well as an easy-to-read tool for research decision makers.",

        "Abstract": "This article explores the influence of economic, social, and geographic factors on the evolution of the Qingming Festival, considering both spatial and temporal dimensions. The primary purpose is to propose new strategies for the protection and inheritance of intangible folk culture, which is an important component of a region's intangible cultural heritage (CH). The Qingming Festival has a rich folk cultural connotation. Exploring it through digital resources can be useful for accomplishing the protection and dissemination of intangible CH folk culture. On the basis of the vividness of folk culture, this study employs the method of intelligence analysis with the help of digital visualization technology. In the temporal dimension, this study explores the influence of significant events on the evolution of the Qingming Festival. In the spatial dimension, this study considers the regions as the nodes of a social network and the main custom of the regions as the connection. Showing the association between the Qingming customs in different regions in the form of a quantitative network map, the spatial dimensions of the Qingming Festival and its inheritance are visualized. The main data sources include the Erudition Database and the WiseNews Database. Through these studies, the evolution process of intangible CH can be vividly presented to the public, and the recognition and attention of the society on intangible CH inheritance and protection can be enhanced. Further, this research makes a significant contribution to the literature because it offers a more comprehensive framework for the analysis of projects concerning intangible CH and provides a method that can be extended to other case studies.

        "Abstract": "Memory research has become a hot topic in the field of digital humanities (DH). DH methods and tools can help to realize the intellectualization and visualization of urban memory. This paper uses the knowledge map (KM) approach to organize, process, and mine archives and documentation data related to urban memory in order to build a map for the reorganization and reconstruction of urban memory. Thus, it proposes a three-tiered \"concept-instance-resource\" conceptual model. Furthermore, it takes the Beijing city gates as a case to test the effectiveness of this conceptual model. We believe this study provides a good exploration of the use of DH methods and tools in memory practice.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: This research investigates structure of the subject trends in the Persian articles published during the period of 2008\u20132012 about \u201cinformation organization\u201d in Iranian journals and creates a semantic map for this domain. This structure has been considered in two sections: First, the weight of each subject term used in articles was indicated, and then the relationships amounts of terms were measured. Content analysis and weighting were used in the first section. The Vector Space Model formula was used in order to weight terms. In the second section, Co-term analysis was used, that is, the number of co-occurrence of any two terms in the same article. Then the term/document occurrence matrix of these terms was created and at last the relations significant between terms were measured by Pearson Correlation Coefficient. To illustrate the structure of information organization domain, Ucinet software was used. Findings show that high-weight categories in Persian articles are: \u201ccataloging\u201d, \u201cinformation retrieval\u201d, \u201cinformation systems\u201d and \u201cauthority files\u201d. Furthermore through weighting, determined that in trends rate aspect, the terms \u201contologies\u201d, \u201ccataloging\u201d, \u201cevaluation\u201d, \u201cDewey Decimal Classification\u201d, \u201cfields\u201d, \u201clibraries and information centers\u201d and \u201cdescriptors\u201d, \u201cFunctional Requirements for Bibliographic Records\u201d, \u201cmetadata elements\u201d and \u201cNational library and archives of I.R. of Iran\u201d are 10 highest-weight terms. Research findings about the relationships of terms show attention to \u201ccataloging\u201d by \u201cIFLA\u201d and \u201cNational library and archives of Iran\u201d and critical approach to this subject. Some other findings about this show: \u201cindexing\u201d are considered by cataloging and thesauri, \u201cmetadata\u201d are considered in web-based and information retrieval points of view, \u201contologies\u201d term is considered in approach of basic concepts, tools and relevance, and attention to some organizations such as \u201cIFLA\u201d and \u201cNational library and archives organization of Iran\u201d besides \u201cusers\u201d and their information needs. In terms of weighting and relationships between the subject terms in Persian articles, \u201ccataloging\u201d is in the center of information organization domain. The semantic map of information organization in Persian articles illustrates three region of subject area including: 1. Cataloging, 2. Ontologies, thesauri and information retrieval, and 3. Metadata and information retrieval.",

We hypothesise, therefore, that structuring an information retrieval system around these three tasks would be beneficial when searching for evidence-based medicine (EBM) resources in medical digital libraries. Task-oriented (diagnosis, test and treatment) information was extracted from free-text medical articles using a natural language processing pipeline. This information was integrated into a retrieval and visualisation system for EBM search that allowed searchers to interact with the system via task-oriented filters. The effectiveness of the system was empirically evaluated using TREC CDS\u2014a gold standard of medical articles and queries designed for EBM search. Task-oriented information was successfully extracted from 733,138 articles taken from a medical digital library. Task-oriented search led to improvements in the quality of search results and savings in searcher workload. An analysis of how different tasks affected retrieval showed that searching for treatments was the most challenging and that the task-oriented approach improved search for treatments. The most savings in terms of workload were observed when searching for treatments and tests. Overall, taking into account different clinical tasks can improve search according to these tasks. Each task displayed different results, making systems that are more adaptive to the clinical task type desirable. A future user study would help quantify the actual cost-saving estimates.",

        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "With the advent and accessibility of the Internet, artistic and indigenous communities are beginning to realize how digital technologies can be used as a means for documenting and preserving their histories and cultures. However, it is not yet clear what knowledge architectures are most appropriate for creating a digital museum in order to facilitate an effective collection, organization, conservation, and experience of cultural and artistic heritage. In this paper, we discuss the concept of \u201cfluid ontologies,\u201d a novel, dynamic structure for organizing and browsing knowledge in a digital museum. Fluid ontologies are flexible knowledge structures that evolve and adapt to communities\u2019 interest based on contextual information articulated by human contributors, curators, and viewers, as well as artificial bots that are able to track interaction histories and infer relationships among knowledge pieces and preferences of viewers. Fluid ontologies allow for a tighter coupling between communities\u2019 interests and the browsing structure of a digital museum. We present the key ideas behind the use of fluid ontologies within the context of digital museum design and seminal work in metadata/dynamic ontologies, particularly as it pertains to objects of cultural heritage, and discuss these characteristics in three concrete examples: (1) Village Voice, an online agora that ties together the narratives created by a group of Somali refugees using an iteration of community-designed ontologies, (2) Eventspace, a node-based collaborative archive for design activities, and (3) Tribal Peace, an online digital museum still under construction and evaluation that uses proactive agents to tie distributed Kumeyaay, Luiseno, and Cupeno reservations together in their quest to achieve greater political sovereignty .",

Present day library Web OPACs architecture does not really help search engine robots or crawlers to index the huge library data.

This paper describes the problem of unfriendliness of library OPACs and the reasons behind this. The paper further suggests the use of sitemaps to expose the bibliographic records to search engines. Further by discussing the different options to create, upload, and submit the sitemaps to search engines, the paper moves to list some of the benefits and concludes by giving some future insights in this area.",

Design/methodology/approach - The methodology relies heavily on anthropological analysis to distinguish the expectations and language of subgroups and microcultures within the larger national and international copyright communities. Findings - At least three different copyright cultures exist: for authors who require long-term protection for financial gain from their works; for authors who require short-term protection for financial gain from their works; and for authors whose value depends on access instead of protection. Important subsets of the author cultures are also copyright consumers whose interests require access as well as protection. Originality/value - This analysis helps to show why existing copyright laws serve the interests of some groups better than others. It also explains why open access makes sense as an established legal alternative to automatic long-term copyright enforcement.",

These basemaps and overlays can be generated at both the 3-digit and 4-digit levels of the International Patent Classification (IPC) of the world intellectual property organization (WIPO). The basemaps can provide a stable mental framework for analysts to follow developments over searches for different years, which can be animated. The full flexibility of the advanced search engines of USPTO are available for generating sets of patents and/or patent applications which can thus be visualized and compared. This instrument allows for addressing questions about technological distance, diversity in portfolios, and animating the developments of both technologies and technological capacities of organizations over time.",

This approach, design- by- adaptation, involves the transfer of interface technology and/or design principles from one application domain to another, in situations where the recipient domain is similar to the host domain in terms of modelled systems, tasks and users. Using the example of interaction in 3D virtual environments, the paper explores how principles underlying the design of videogame interfaces may be applied to a broad family of visualization and analysis software which handles geographical data (virtual geographic environments, or VGEs). One of the motivations behind the current study is that VGE technology lags some way behind videogame technology in the modelling of 3D environments, and has a less-developed track record in providing the variety of interaction methods needed to undertake varied tasks in 3D virtual worlds by users with varied levels of experience. The current analysis extracted a set of interaction principles from videogames which were used to devise a set of 3D task interfaces that have been implemented in a prototype VGE for formal evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "More than half of all cancer patients receive ionizing radiation as part of their treatment. Treatment outcomes are determined by complex interactions between cancer genetics, treatment regimens, and patient-related variables. A key component of modern radiation oncology research is to predict at the time of treatment planning or during the course of fractionated radiation treatment, the probability of tumor eradication and normal tissue risks for the type of treatment being considered for the individual patient. A typical radiotherapy treatment scenario can generate a large pool of panomics data that may comprise 3D/4D anatomical and functional imaging information (noted as radiomics), in addition to biological markers (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) derived from peripheral blood and tissue specimens. Radiotherapy data informatics constitutes a unique interface between physical and biological processes. It can benefit from the general advances in biomedical informatics research while still requires the development of its own technologies within this framework to address specific issues related to its unique physics-biology interface. We review recent advances and discuss current challenges to interrogate panomics data in radiotherapy using bioinformatics tools for data aggregation, sharing, visualization, and outcomes modeling. We provide examples based on our and others experiences using systems radiobiology and machine learning to develop predictive models of outcomes in radiotherapy. We also highlight the potential opportunities in this field for evidence-based personalized medicine research for bioinformaticians and clinical decision-makers.

We retrieved a total of 10,062 records of nanotechnology papers authored by Turkish researchers between 2000 and 2011 from Web of Science and divided the data set into two 6-year periods. We analyzed the most prolific and collaborative authors and universities on individual, institutional and international levels based on their network properties (e.g., centrality) as well as the nanotechnology research topics studied most often by the Turkish researchers. We used co-word analysis and mapping to identify the major nanotechnology research fields in Turkey on the basis of the co-occurrence of words in the titles of papers. We found that nanotechnology research and development in Turkey is on the rise and its diffusion and adoption have increased tremendously thanks to the Turkish government's decision a decade ago identifying nanotechnology as a strategic field and providing constant support since then. Turkish researchers tend to collaborate within their own groups or universities and the overall connectedness of the network is thus low. Their publication and collaboration patterns conform to Lotka's law. They work mainly on nanotechnology applications in Materials Sciences, Chemistry and Physics, among others. This is commensurate, more or less, with the global trends in nanotechnology research and development.",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The Student Support and Education Analytics team at UOW is tasked with creating policy, frameworks and infrastructure for the systematic capture, mapping and analysis of data from the across the university. The initial data set includes: log file data from Moodle sites, Library Cube, student administration data, tutorials and student support service usage data. Using the learning analytics data warehouse UOW is developing new models for analysis and visualisation with a focus on the provision of near real-time data to academic staff and students to optimise learning opportunities. Findings \u2013 The distinct advantage of the learning analytics model is that the selected data sets are updated weekly, enabling near real-time monitoring and intervention where required. Inclusion of library data with the other often disparate data sets from across the university has enabled development of a comprehensive platform for learning analytics. Future work will include the development of predictive models using the rapidly growing learning analytics data warehouse. Practical implications \u2013 Data warehousing infrastructure, the systematic capture and exporting of relevant library data sets are requisite for the consideration of library data in learning analytics. Originality/value \u2013 What was not anticipated five years ago when the Value Cube was first realised, was the development of learning analytic services at UOW. The Cube afforded University of Wollongong Library considerable advantage: the framework for data harvesting and analysis was established, ready for inclusion within learning analytics data sets and subsequent reporting to faculty.",

        "Abstract": "While art history students frequently are required to write research papers, they often have trouble understanding some of the more abstract constructs they encounter. They may struggle to grasp the role that research plays in probing questions about the relationships between people, places, and events that compose complex historical periods. This article describes a collaboration between an art history professor, a librarian, and a digital humanities specialist in which students were taught how to conduct research for an art history course on German art 1900 to the present and then visualize that research through story maps created with ArcGIS. Through these mapping projects, students were encouraged to engage with the history of German art on a physical level by mapping spatial relationships between social networks, artists' studios, exhibition venues, art museums, architecture, and other important historical sites that were integral to the development of major art movements. This case study article outlines the project, including its learning outcomes, pedagogical strategies, student products, and assessment data. In addition, it describes how the project developed through different iterations. Ultimately, this collaborative, interdisciplinary project may provide a model for ways that visualization in general and map creation in particular can be used as a teaching strategy to make art history come alive for students by opening new conceptual territory, prompting intriguing questions, generating unique answers, and engaging art history in a more physical, spatial manner.",

Yet music research in the digital humanities has attended little to socio-cultural context, tradition, history and performance knowledge, instead focusing on the musical score and technical elements. To have an impact on music scholarship, digital research in the music domain must be considered more broadly. An example is the work of Alexander Chan, whose cutting edge music research may be appreciated as interactive installations but gets little recognition within digital humanities. Music research has fallen short in its use of digital technology to understand theory, composition, musicology and the preservation and transmission of music knowledge. Despite music's evocative power, its conceptual scope in digital research is narrow.",

Readers are also invited to create a new scenario. Readers then can reflect on the skills and aptitudes librarians would need to have or acquire in order to succeed in one of the scenarios. The method involves visualization, reflection, and self-assessment.Findings The authors have tested this exercise in in-service training with public, academic, and special librarians as well as with students in graduate library and information science courses. The end result is deep conversation, engagement, and sharing.Research limitations/implications The authors have observations on the effectiveness of this future exercise with students and practicing librarians but did not structure its use as a research project. In years of attending conferences and delivering over 600 conference presentations, the authors have yet to observe a similar future exercise being employed.Practical implications This exercise promotes reflection and discussion. It enables librarians to consider these scenarios on their own or in groups of varying sizes. It has application in understanding the complexity of futurism and how it might impact their future lives. And it emphases that individual librarians have some degree of independence in how they respond to change and, ultimately, a future much different from the present.Social implications Libraries are social institutions and their services reflect and respond to changes in society. Recent changes in governance around the world, warfare, the refugee crisis, and episodes of violence have contributed to tension. These are the times when librarians are called on more than ever to respond. Considering possible and improbable futures and one\u2019s response to those futures are helpful in preparing one\u2019s professional response in these difficult times.Originality/value This paper introduces an original model for discussing many possible futures for libraries and for librarians to consider their roles in those futures.",

        "Abstract": "Although the effects of spatial abilities on behaviour have recently been a hot topic, wayfinding has received little attentions. Here, the reasons for route selection differences during wayfinding were studied from the perspective of individual competence. The mental rotation (A-MR), abstract reasoning (A-AR), visual short-term memory (A-VSTM), spatial perception (A-SP) and spatial orientation (A-SO) abilities of 52 college students were assessed, and their route selection behaviours were tested in homogeneous and heterogeneous three-dimensional virtual scenes. Finally, the relationships between five abilities and the lengths (R-L) and angles (R-A) of the selected routes were analysed and the R meants route here. The path complexity (weighted combination of R-L and R-A) was also fitted using a partial least-squares model with the five abilities. The A-MR and A-AR had obvious relationships with R-L and R-A, whereas A-SP showed little correlation. Moreover, the A-VSTM and A-SO had a significantly higher impact on route selection in the homogeneous spatial environment than in the heterogeneous one. Although the models passed the significance test, the fitting effect was not satisfactory. The routes were affected by many factors, and these five abilities could not fully explain the route selection behaviour of the individuals.",

Description: To lower the entry barrier to VR, the Technology Team collaborated with the IU Advanced Visualization Lab to establish a reality lab in our collaborative learning space. The lab opened in the fall of 2018 and consists of four high-end VR stations that are accessible to students at any time, but they can also make an appointment for a more guided experience. Information and instructions are available on a LibGuide. Conclusion: We are currently collecting data on the number of unique users and evaluating application usage. We are working on a feedback mechanism and looking to develop collaborative partnerships across the university.",

        "Abstract": "Objective UK primary care databases, which contain diagnostic, demographic and prescribing information for millions of patients geographically representative of the UK, represent a significant resource for health services and clinical research. They can be used to identify patients with a specified disease or condition (phenotyping) and to investigate patterns of diagnosis and symptoms. Currently, extracting such information manually is time-consuming and requires considerable expertise. In order to exploit more fully the potential of these large and complex databases, our interdisciplinary team developed generic methods allowing access to different types of user. Materials and methods Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database, we have developed an online user-focused system (TrialViz), which enables users interactively to select suitable medical general practices based on two criteria: suitability of the patient base for the intended study (phenotyping) and measures of data quality. Results An end-to-end system, underpinned by an innovative search algorithm, allows the user to extract information in near real-time via an intuitive query interface and to explore this information using interactive visualization tools. A usability evaluation of this system produced positive results. Discussion We present the challenges and results in the development of TrialViz and our plans for its extension for wider applications of clinical research. Conclusions Our fast search algorithms and simple query algorithms represent a significant advance for users of clinical research databases.",

Bibliometric analysis, including publication growth analysis, core authors and collaborative degree analysis, core journals analysis, and institutions distribution, was performed. The temporal visualization map of burst term was drawn, and the co-occurrence matrix of these keywords was analyzed by the hierarchical cluster analysis, strategic diagram, and social network analysis.Findings The earliest article on information behavior in China was published in 1987. And the number of articles has risen continually since then, which follows the logical growth law of literature. The collaborative degree of authors is on the rise in general. The distribution of these articles obeys the Bradford\u2019s Law of Scattering. School of Information Management of Wuhan University remarkably ranks the top in most publications. In all, ten important research directions were identified, which are in the imbalanced development. And a newly appearing topic with great potential for further development, namely information seeking and information security, is identified.Originality/value This study provides important insights into the research status and trends on information behavior in China, which might provide a potential guide for the future research.",

        "Abstract": "The shortage of water resources is a global issue. This study attempts to utilise eco-visualisation interface design to affect users\u2019 water-usage behaviour. Three interface proposals were designed in this study: numeric, water droplet (abstract symbol), and swimming fish (animated image). These three different interface formats range from abstract to figurative and from neutral to affective. A total of 93 subjects were divided into three groups and randomly performed designated dishwashing tasks twice. One of the tasks was completed without the assistance of any interface, whereas the other involved applying one of the three interface formats with eco-visualisations. In this study, the Self-Assessment Manikin scales, the System Usability Scale, and the Questionnaires for User Interaction Satisfaction were used to measure the emotional dimensions and perceived usability and to record the differences in water usage volume. The results indicated that the emotional valence evoked by the animated image interface was significantly higher than that by the numeric interface. The effect of the numeric interface formats on the subjects focused on emotional arousal, whereas other interfaces emphasised emotional valence. With the aid of the eco-visualisations of interface design, the evoked emotional response and enhanced usability could help improve sustainable behaviours towards water saving.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose - This paper aims to explore the theory and practice of knowledge organization and its necessary connection to human perception, and shows a solution of the potential ones. Design/methodology/approach - The author attempts to survey the problem of concept-building and extension, as well as the determination of semantics in different aspects. The purpose is to find criteria for the choice of the solution that best incorporates users into the design cycles of knowledge organization systems. Findings - It is widely agreed that cognition provides the basis for concept-building; however, at the next stage of processing there is a debate. Fundamentally, what is the connection between perception and the superior cognitive processes? The perceptual method does not separate these two but rather considers them united, with perception permeating cognition. By contrast, the linguistic method considers perception as an information-receiving system. Separate from, and following, perception, the cognitive subsystems then perform information and data processing, leading to both knowledge organization and representation. We assume by that model that top-level concepts emerge from knowledge organization and representation. This paper points obvious connection of visual imagery and the internet; perceptual access of knowledge organization and information retrieval. There are some practical and characteristic solutions for the visualization of information without demand of completeness. Research limitations/implications - Librarians need to identify those semantic characteristics which stimulate a similar conceptual image both in the mind of the librarian and in the mind of the user. Originality/value - For a fresh perspective, an understanding of perception is required as well.",

This would give the surgeons direct access to their patients\u2019 scan data without compromising their sterile working field and without needing to rely on other clinicians to interpret display instructions. Our approach involved interviewing surgeons and observing them in the operating theatre. We included evidence from earlier publications in this field and we used a grounded theory approach to analyse our data. Our findings address diversity across the surgical specialties, preoperative versus intraoperative use of the data, preferences for simple natural gestures, the role of another person controlling the display, broad system constraints and the willingness of surgeons to collaborate with their time and effort in this research.",

        "Abstract": "Two studies are reported that examined the reliability of human assessments of document similarity and the association between human ratings and the results of n-gram automatic text analysis (ATA). Human interassessor reliability (IAR) was moderate to poor. However, correlations between average human ratings and n-gram solutions were strong. The average correlation between ATA and individual human solutions was greater than IAR. N-gram length influenced the strength of association, but optimum string length depended on the nature of the text (technical vs. nontechnical). We conclude that the methodology applied in previous studies may have led to overoptimistic views on human reliability, but that an optimal n-gram solution can provide a good approximation of the average human assessment of document similarity, a result that has important implications for future development of document visualization systems.",

        "Abstract": "Retracting published scientific articles is increasingly common. Retraction is a self-correction mechanism of the scientific community to maintain and safeguard the integrity of scientific literature. However, a retracted article may pose a profound and long-lasting threat to the credibility of the literature. New articles may unknowingly build their work on false claims made in retracted articles. Such dependencies on retracted articles may become implicit and indirect. Consequently, it becomes increasingly important to detect implicit and indirect threats. In this article, our aim is to raise the awareness of the potential threats of retracted articles even after their retraction and demonstrate a visual analytic study of retracted articles with reference to the rest of the literature and how their citations are influenced by their retraction. The context of highly cited retracted articles is visualized in terms of a co-citation network as well as the distribution of articles that have high-order citation dependencies on retracted articles. Survival analyses of time to retraction and postretraction citation are included. Sentences that explicitly cite retracted articles are extracted from full-text articles. Transitions of topics over time are depicted in topic-flow visualizations. We recommend that new visual analytic and science mapping tools should take retracted articles into account and facilitate tasks specifically related to the detection and monitoring of retracted articles.",

This article catches several metadata in full text of citing papers but not aims at content-level information, which increases the amount of information input to ACA without increasing computational complexity a lot. We propose a new method by involving information including the number of mentioned times in a citing paper and the number of context words in a citing sentence. We combine these pieces of information into the traditional ACA and compare the results between ACA and the proposed approach by using factor analysis, network analysis, and MDS-measurement. The result of our empirical study indicates that compared with the traditional ACA, the proposed method shows a better clustering performance in visualizations and reveals more details in displaying intellectual structures.",

        "Abstract": "Data of interest to biomedical researchers associated with the Human Genome Project (HGP) is stored all over the world in a number of different electronic data formats and accessible through a variety of interfaces and retrieval languages. These data sources include conventional relational databases with SQL interfaces, formatted text files on top of which indexing is provided for efficient retrieval (ASN.1-Entrez), and binary files that can be interpreted textually or graphically via special purpose interfaces (ACeDB). Researchers within the HGP want to combine data from these different data sources, add value through sophisticated data analysis techniques (such as the biosequence comparison software BLAST and FASTA), and view it using special purpose scientific visualization tools. However, currently there are no commercial tools for enabling such an integrated digital library, and a fundamental barrier to developing such tools appears to be one of language design and optimization: The data formats and software packages found throughout the HGP contain a number of data types not available in conventional databases, such as lists, variants and arrays; furthermore, these types may be deeply nested. We present in this paper a framework for providing read access to multiple data sources with complex structured data, and illustrate its use in an application called BioKleisli which accesses data sources critical to the HGP. The three primary components of this framework are: (1) a powerful language for querying and transforming complex structured data; (2) an extensible architecture for implementing the query primitives; and (3) optimization techniques that extend many known techniques to these more complex data types.",

Hannon Library at Loyola Marymount University explored user behaviour in the Information Commons, user preferences for furniture style and configuration, and how users engaged with a mix of technology, resources, and activities inside the space. Methods \u2013 The researchers used a mixed-methods case study consisting of 2,443 \u201cdirect observations,\u201d 646 environmental scans, 248 patron surveys, and 46 whiteboard poll questions. They created visualizations of results in Tableau, with filters for zone and variable. They then carried out a follow-up furniture preferences survey with 190 respondents. Results \u2013 Independent study dominated the space usage. Users valued spaciousness, quiet, privacy, and a clean environment. Users frequently multi-tasked with additional devices as they simultaneously used the library computers, including cell phones, headphones, and laptops. The majority of students self-reported using a library computer for email and to access the campus online learning platform. They also reported reading/studying and printing as frequent activities, although these were less frequently observed. Unattended belongings were observed along with broken electrical outlets. Temperature and noise levels were highly variable. Conclusions \u2013 This methodology allowed for the exploration of space use and satisfaction and uncovered implications for the redesign of the library space. The library has already taken steps toward making improvements based on this assessment project including: removing some reference stacks in favor of additional seating space, an inventory of all electrical outlets, and the exploration of new furniture and noise control strategies.",

Augmented Reality offers the possibility of displaying digital information over physical spaces. This allows for a single interaction environment, rather than splitting interaction and display over different interfaces. AR provides a useful tool for the visualization of adaptive hypermedia systems. Adaptive Hypermedia research focuses on techniques for presenting hypermedia information that has been adapted to the specific requirements of the reader of the hypermedia. Adaptive hyperstructures can simplify and focus the information being shown to a reader, but the new contextual dimension can also add to the complexity of the hypermedia structures being served. Tangible AR is the application of tangible user interface techniques to AR environments. It is a physical interaction metaphor that attempts to take advantage of a user's existing experience of manipulating objects in the real world.",

This article describes an ontology-driven framework implemented to provide knowledge management for data of different modalities, with multimedia processing, annotation, and reasoning provided by remote services. The framework was developed in, and is presented in the context of, the Medical Imaging and Advanced Knowledge Technologies (MIAKT) project that sought to support the Multidisciplinary Meetings (MDMs) that take place during breast cancer screening for diagnosing the patient. However, the architecture is entirely independent of the specific application domain and can be quickly prototyped into new domains. An Enterprise server provides resource access to a client-side presentation application which, in turn, provides knowledge visualization and markup of any supported media, as defined by a domain-dependent ontology-supported language.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes how the Teaching and Learning Research Programme (TLRP) has implemented and applied DSpace as a digital repository for project and programme outputs, including published articles, conference papers, research reports, briefings and press releases. The DSpace repository has become a major element in the user engagement strategy of the programme. The OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative) interface provides a basis for the development of a number of user applications and services for projects and other interested groups, including search interfaces, dynamic web content, RSS feeds and other services. These have also formed the basis of collaboration and communication between the TLRP and other research programmes, indexes and resources. The TLRP aims to enable collaboration between researchers and to foster individual, institutional and sector-wide research capacity. The OAI interface has been used as the basis of data visualisation tools, allowing the identification of distinctive patterns of collaboration across the diverse projects of the programme. The paper will conclude with some reflections on the relevance of the output of these tools to teachers and their practice.",

In hospitals, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) Beacon, indoor messaging system, and similar methods have generally been used for tracking, with Wi-Fi and BLE being the most common. Recently, nurses are increasingly using mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, while shifting. The accuracy when using Wi-Fi or BLE may be affected by interference or multipath propagation. In this research, we evaluated the positioning accuracy of geomagnetic indoor positioning in hospitals.<bold>Materials and Methods: </bold>We compared the position measurement accuracy of a geomagnetic method alone, Wi-Fi alone, BLE beacons alone, geomagnetic plus Wi-Fi, and geomagnetic plus BLE in a general inpatient ward, using a geomagnetic positioning algorithm by GiPStech. The existing Wi-Fi infrastructure was used, and 20 additional BLE beacons were installed. Our first experiment compared these methods' accuracy for 8 test routes, while the second experiment verified a combined geomagnetic/BLE beacon method using 3 routes based on actual daily activities.<bold>Results: </bold>The experimental results demonstrated that the most accurate method was geomagnetic/BLE, followed by geomagnetic/Wi-Fi, and then geomagnetic alone.<bold>Discussion: </bold>The geomagnetic method's positioning accuracy varied widely, but combining it with BLE beacons reduced the average position error to approximately 1.2 m, and the positioning accuracy could be improved further. We believe this could effectively target humans (patients) where errors of up to 3 m can generally be tolerated.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>In conjunction with BLE beacons, geomagnetic positioning could be sufficiently effective for many in-hospital localization tasks.",

        "Abstract": "Objective As large-scale medical imaging studies are becoming more common, there is an increasing reliance on automated software to extract quantitative information from these images. As the size of the cohorts keeps increasing with large studies, there is a also a need for tools that allow results from automated image processing and analysis to be presented in a way that enables fast and efficient quality checking, tagging and reporting on cases in which automatic processing failed or was problematic. Materials and methods MilxXplore is an open source visualization platform, which provides an interface to navigate and explore imaging data in a web browser, giving the end user the opportunity to perform quality control and reporting in a user friendly, collaborative and efficient way. Discussion Compared to existing software solutions that often provide an overview of the results at the subject's level, MilxXplore pools the results of individual subjects and time points together, allowing easy and efficient navigation and browsing through the different acquisitions of a subject over time, and comparing the results against the rest of the population. Conclusions MilxXplore is fast, flexible and allows remote quality checks of processed imaging data, facilitating data sharing and collaboration across multiple locations, and can be easily integrated into a cloud computing pipeline. With the growing trend of open data and open science, such a tool will become increasingly important to share and publish results of imaging analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: Over the last decade, we have seen a tremendous increase in the number of digital media types that we deal with as part of our daily work. While the Web with its linking functionality was originally designed for organizing information in the form of HTML documents containing embedded media such as images, movies and sounds, the underlying hypertext model is not flexible enough to deal with new media types. A flexible link and annotation service should not only support a growing set of digital media types, but also pay attention to emerging possibilities for linking and integrating the physical environment with digital information spaces in the form of augmented reality environments. The successful implementation of these so-called cross-media information spaces, where different types of digital information get linked and integrated with physical entities, demands for a rethinking of models and architectures for extensible and scalable cross-media annotation and linking. In this paper, we present our general model for open cross-media annotation and link services and highlight how this model enabled the realization of an extensible cross-media architecture. We further introduce the concept of open cross-media information spaces where the integration of new media types on the data level as well as on the visualization level is supported via a resource plug-in mechanism.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Twitter is now well established as the world's second most important social media platform, after Facebook. Its 140-character updates are designed for brief messaging, and its network structures are kept relatively flat and simple: messages from users are either public and visible to all (even to unregistered visitors using the Twitter website), or private and visible only to approved \u2018followers\u2019 of the sender; there are no more complex definitions of degrees of connection (family, friends, friends of friends) as they are available in other social networks. Over time, Twitter users have developed simple, but effective mechanisms for working around these limitations: \u2018#hashtags\u2019, which enable the manual or automatic collation of all tweets containing the same #hashtag, as well allowing users to subscribe to content feeds that contain only those tweets which feature specific #hashtags; and \u2018@replies\u2019, which allow senders to direct public messages even to users whom they do not already follow. This paper documents a methodology for extracting public Twitter activity data around specific #hashtags, and for processing these data in order to analyse and visualize the @reply networks existing between participating users \u2013 both overall, as a static network, and over time, to highlight the dynamic structure of @reply conversations. Such visualizations enable us to highlight the shifting roles played by individual participants, as well as the response of the overall #hashtag community to new stimuli \u2013 such as the entry of new participants or the availability of new information. Over longer timeframes, it is also possible to identify different phases in the overall discussion, or the formation of distinct clusters of preferentially interacting participants.",

Most acute coronary events result from rupture of the protective fibrous cap overlying an atherosclerotic plaque. The task of early identification of plaque types that can potentially rupture is, therefore, of great importance. The state-of-the-art approach to imaging blood vessels is intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT). However, currently, this is an offline approach where the images are first collected and then manually analyzed an image at a time to identify regions at risk of thrombosis. This process is extremely laborious, time consuming, and prone to human error. We are building a system that, when complete, will provide interactive three-dimensional visualization of a blood vessel as an IVOCT is in progress. The visualization will highlight different plaque types and enable quick identification of regions at risk. In this article, we describe our approach, focusing on machine-learning methods that are a key enabling technology. Our empirical results using real OCT data show that our approach can identify different plaque types efficiently with high accuracy across multiple patients.",

However, several researchers argue that little is known about the cognitive value of graphical representations, be they schematic visualizations, such as diagrams or more realistic, such as virtual reality. The study reported in the paper investigated whether the type of visualization (schematic versus realistic) has an effect on undergraduate students' learning of surveying practices (specifically, 'chaining'). The study compared two interactive virtual learning environments, one containing realistic visualizations of terrains and instruments, and one containing schematic graphical representations. Results of an experiment with 62 students show that there were not significant differences in learning between students who were exposed and interacted with the realistic visualizations versus those who interacted with the schematic ones.",

The empirical part of the article is structured as follows. First, we provide the overview of publication activity and thematic structure of BRICS countries. Second, we measure the closeness of thematic structure of publications versus each other and versus general research agenda in the world using different indices of structural difference. Third part is the analysis of research collaboration with clear visualization of its thematic structure, identification of potential areas of collaboration and detection the influential countries in intra-BRICS collaborating pairs. We use wide range of bibliometric indicators: citation indicators; indices of structural difference; indicators of scientific collaboration. We apply different approaches to visualise data in form of different illustrative graphs including colored tables to do our research easy-to-read-and understand. The results of the study may be of interest to decision makers in determining the conscientious research story of the BRICS countries and priorities setting for multilateral scientific and technological cooperation, as well as for researchers dealing with relevant problems.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, Graphical Abstracts (GA) are increasingly being used in scholarly articles in order to enhance browsing and aid in paper selection. This study aims to demonstrate how GAs have been adopted in the social sciences. In the social sciences, GAs appeared for the first time in 2010, and from 2011 to 2015 a 350% increase was observed. Forty-seven percent of journals related to the social sciences have published at least one article with a GA. Among the social science disciplines, social and economic geography has most actively adopted GAs, whereas, in law, GAs are still not used. Authors use GAs to present: 1) an overview of the article, including the research process and key results (sometimes with background), 2) the key results of the study, 3) the research process or methods used, and 4) the background of the study. Authors re-use the visualizations in their manuscripts, integrate or modify the visualizations in their manuscripts, or create a new visualization for the GA. Depending on the content of GAs, different types of visualizations are used; for example, charts are mainly used to represent results and diagrams are used to present research methods or provide an overview of the article. Areas of future research into GAs are suggested.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "In the last few years, there is an increasing interest to generate visual representations of very large scientific domains. A methodology based on the combined use of ISI\u2013JCR category cocitation and social networks analysis through the use of the Pathfinder algorithm has demonstrated its ability to achieve high quality, schematic visualizations for these kinds of domains. Now, the next step would be to generate these scientograms in an on-line fashion. To do so, there is a need to significantly decrease the run time of the latter pruning technique when working with category cocitation matrices of a large dimension like the ones handled in these large domains (Pathfinder has a time complexity order of O(n 4), with n being the number of categories in the cocitation matrix, i.e., the number of nodes in the network). Although a previous improvement called Binary Pathfinder has already been proposed to speed up the original algorithm, its significant time complexity reduction is not enough for that aim. In this paper, we make use of a different shortest path computation from classical approaches in computer science graph theory to propose a new variant of the Pathfinder algorithm which allows us to reduce its time complexity in one order of magnitude, O(n 3), and thus to significantly decrease the run time of the implementation when applied to large scientific domains considering the parameter q = n \u22121. Besides, the new algorithm has a much simpler structure than the Binary Pathfinder as well as it saves a significant amount of memory with respect to the original Pathfinder by reducing the space complexity to the need of just storing two matrices. An experimental comparison will be developed using large networks from real-world domains to show the good performance of the new proposal.",

Yet the experienced pathway and evolutionary steps evidence the points that need be resolved to successfully deliver and transition to learning analytics solutions that have previously been conceptually proposed or tested at small scales in other studies. The key findings through the process highlight the level of uplift (in tech, capacity and capability) that universities need to meet contemporary demands and future possibilities. \u2022 Placing the learning analytics strategy in practice can be a treacherous road. \u2022 Cross-unit collaboration is essential, with continuous feedback from academics. \u2022 Fail fast strategies work when proper communication strategies are in place. \u2022 Out-of-the-box solutions will most likely not serve the needs for academics and L&T research. \u2022 Data pipelines need to be simplified and allowing connectivity with sandboxes.",

        "Abstract": "Improving learning and synthesis of new knowledge is often a challenge for nursing faculty in the twenty-first century. Faculty are urged to use new technologies and to embrace methodologies that include more interactions by the student. Today's students are less adept in written and oral communication and, consequently, more hesitant to speak out or write independently for fear of ridicule by others. These same students, by virtue of their adaptation and immersion in technological advances, need support in using these same mechanisms to improve their communication skills. Interpersonal communication across many levels is very important in nursing. This article summarizes a study of nursing students at North Carolina Central University in the spring of 2011 and their use of social networking to communicate about nursing education and medical errors. This qualitative pilot study used new social media known as web logs (blogs) to enable students to become more secure communicating with one another. The tool was a Google-based blog. The nursing students' interaction styles were evaluated based on topics and inter-connections. Visualizations of the social network communications as maps are provided with the article to illustrate data analysis results. As a pilot study the research may be used for system design requirements for a medical educational environment that promotes sharing information and collecting data related to quality care and learning. Potential social media tools for future consideration include Facebook, Twitter, blogs, electronic journals, forums (or chat rooms), and wikis (group-authored encyclopedia/information sites) as found on the web, on smart phones and in online education tools. This research project was based on an earlier study of nursing students using blogs and sharing medical error information in confidence. The researchers on the 2011 project have found that analyzing, for example, how students support each other during school, learn about drug calculations and NCLEX examination preparations, by means of social networking could lead to ways to reduce errors as students develop communication habits, share knowledge, and pay more attention to tasks.",

NCIBI supports information access and data analysis for biomedical researchers, enabling them to build computational and knowledge models of biological systems to address the Driving Biological Problems (DBPs). The NCIBI DBPs have included prostate cancer progression, organ-specific complications of type 1 and 2 diabetes, bipolar disorder, and metabolic analysis of obesity syndrome. Collaborating with these and other partners, NCIBI has developed a series of software tools for exploratory analysis, concept visualization, and literature searches, as well as core database and web services resources. Many of our training and outreach initiatives have been in collaboration with the Research Centers at Minority Institutions (RCMI), integrating NCIBI and RCMI faculty and students, culminating each year in an annual workshop. Our future directions include focusing on the TranSMART data sharing and analysis initiative.",

It also looks at Omeka\u2019s major features through a theoretical lens of exhibit orientation that provides another way to assess it as a digital content tool.Design/methodology/approach The case study method was selected to review four comparable exhibits from the same institution. The Omeka software was evaluated through a lens of exhibit design that includes two orientations (object vs information) and multiple goals (object identification and display, engagement, interpretation and education).Findings Omeka is a valuable tool for digital exhibits because of its strength in knowledge representation through a standard metadata scheme, the ability to group items that have some aspect in common such as author or topic, and its support of narrative exhibits incorporating text and images. Omeka needs some additional support, however, to fulfill more complex goals such as user engagement, object interpretation and user education.Originality/value The paper grounds the examination of Omeka within a theoretical framework of exhibit orientation that enriches its observations and conclusions.",

The user is thus able to analyze the citation environment in terms of links and graphs. Furthermore, the local impact of a journal is defined as its share of the total citations in the specific journal's citation environments; the vertical size of the nodes is varied proportionally to this citation impact. The horizontal size of each node can be used to provide the same information after correction for within-journal (self-)citations. In the \u201cciting\u201d environment, the equivalents of this measure can be considered as a citation activity index which maps how the relevant journal environment is perceived by the collective of authors of a given journal.

        "Abstract": "770 million motorcycles are estimated on the roads. Motorcyclists represent more than 380,000 annual deaths worldwide. 28% of the global fatalities in the roads in 2016. With the increase of the accident rate, studies have been developed within the scientific literature. Bibliometric analysis is applied in the field of motorcycle safety in order to identify relevant publications on risk factors of road crashes and their implications. The information in this research was extracted from Web of Science and Scopus databases between 1947 and May 31, 2018. The study identified the key bibliometric indicators such as publications, authors, journals, countries, institutions, citation and co-citation analysis, subject categories, and co-occurrence of terms. EndNote, Microsoft Excel, Statgraphics Centurion and VOS-viewer software were used for the analysis. In total, 1813 articles were considered. The publications from 2000 to 2017 exhibits an average growth of 9%. The journal \"Accident Analysis and Prevention\" was the key issue in the publication and citation. The top institutions were the University of California, Universiti Putra Malaysia, and Monash University. The average citation of the top 10 articles was 134. A network visualization map showed that 'vehicle', 'model', 'system', 'road', 'safety', and 'behavior' were the most commons key terms. Bibliometric analysis demonstrates a high collaboration between authors and institutions. Two growing trends were identified. First, studies on the protection of the motorcyclist and the safe design considering the performance. Second, studies in analysis, characterization, and prevention of accidents. These studies are more related to the generation of strategies for the protection of road safety for motorcyclists.",

However, using Scopus data for drawing historiograms with HistCite\u2122 has hitherto been a problem. In the new version of the program CRExplorer, one can translate citation data from Scopus to WoS formats (or vice versa) and then import the data into HistCite\u2122. In this brief communication, we demonstrate these options using the papers of Eugene Garfield (1925-2017) in Scopus for main-path analysis. The two historiograms are considerably different: unlike the WoS set, the networked connections between the time lines are sparse in the representation of the Scopus data; the secondary documents (e.g., editorials in Current Contents) not processed in Scopus, but included in WoS enrich the representation. Furthermore, HistCite\u2122 has an option to export the citation network as a Pajek file that can be read by most network analysis and visualization programs. Garfield's texts are centered by him as a personality and entrepreneur in different domains more than intellectually, although there are a number of recurring themes. Our own main paths are shaped along a line along which components indicate longer-term projects.",

To address this, the article presents a study of science learning in a computer-supported learning environment called Collaborative Science Inquiry (CSI), which integrates guided inquiry principles for activity design, employs modelling and visualisation tools for promoting conceptual understanding and incorporates key computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) elements for enabling students\u2019 collaboration. With the aim of understanding the process of students\u2019 conceptual changes supported by the CSI learning environment as used in a secondary school, data on students\u2019 test achievements, responses to learning tasks and peer discussions in collaboration were collected, analysed and discussed. The results of the qualitative and quantitative data analysis indicated that guided inquiry coupled with CSCL elements facilitated by the CSI system can engage students in inquiry activities and promote their conceptual understanding in a progressive way.",

A diverse set of stakeholders and the challenge to apply novel technologies in a demanding environment have placed more responsibility on the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) team to conceptualise new work practices and their expected effects than what traditional participatory design projects typically entail. By combining the methodologies of genre analysis and pattern languages, design pattern maps have been used to conceptualise solutions that span both work and interface aspects of the solution and that match declared values of the stakeholders concerned. A series of mapping sessions with different stakeholders helped the inter-disciplinary project team to better define, what stakeholder values called for what new work patterns and what kind of supporting interaction design patterns these new work patterns in turn called for.",

It works on out-link references of articles (i.e., those references cited by the articles), and is essential for relatedness analysis and topic clustering of scholarly articles. In this paper, we present a new BC measure DescriptiveBC, which employs the titles of the out-link references to improve BC in two ways: given a target article a, DescriptiveBC provides more accurate information about how (based on numerical inter-article similarity) and why (based on textual descriptive terms) a scholarly article is related to a. Visualization of the information can support the identification, clustering, mapping, and navigation of the related evidence in scientific literature. Empirical evaluation justifies the contributions of DescriptiveBC. Release of the reference titles in each article is thus helpful for the dissemination of research findings in scientific literature, and DescriptiveBC can be incorporated into search engines of scholarly articles to help prospective researchers to navigate through the space of related articles online.",

However, there are no published bibliometric reports that have analyzed the corresponding scientific literature in relation to the application of these technologies in medicine.<bold>Objective: </bold>We used a bibliometric approach to identify and analyze the scientific literature on VR and AR research in medicine, revealing the popular research topics, key authors, scientific institutions, countries, and journals. We further aimed to capture and describe the themes and medical conditions most commonly investigated by VR and AR research.<bold>Methods: </bold>The Web of Science electronic database was searched to identify relevant papers on VR research in medicine. Basic publication and citation data were acquired using the \"Analyze\" and \"Create Citation Report\" functions of the database. Complete bibliographic data were exported to VOSviewer and Bibliometrix, dedicated bibliometric software packages, for further analyses. Visualization maps were generated to illustrate the recurring keywords and words mentioned in the titles and abstracts.<bold>Results: </bold>The analysis was based on data from 8399 papers. Major research themes were diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as rehabilitation. Commonly studied medical conditions were pain, stroke, anxiety, depression, fear, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Overall, contributions to the literature were globally distributed with heaviest contributions from the United States and United Kingdom. Studies from more clinically related research areas such as surgery, psychology, neurosciences, and rehabilitation had higher average numbers of citations than studies from computer sciences and engineering.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The conducted bibliometric analysis unequivocally reveals the versatile emerging applications of VR and AR in medicine. With the further maturation of the technology and improved accessibility in countries where VR and AR research is strong, we expect it to have a marked impact on clinical practice and in the life of patients.",

However, in most construction curricula, safety is considered a low priority, and safety education is delivered in isolation, without sufficient interaction and practical experience to improve safety learning. On the other hand, anatomical theory in medicine has been adopted by and proved advantageous to various scientific disciplines. With this regard, this study presents an interactive construction safety education system using building anatomy modelling (BAM) based on the integration of anatomical theory and state-of-the-art visualization technologies. The BAM system comprises two modules: (1) knowledge acquisition module, which delivers safety knowledge to students; and (2) practical experience module, which enables students to interact with BAM to improve their hazard identification and elimination skills. The building anatomy concept (BAC) and BAM prototype are evaluated through interactive system trials with educators and learners. Findings suggest the BAC has significant pedagogic potential, and the proposed system can effectively provide safety knowledge and interactively support the development of practical safety skills of learners.",

For a community, people's PISs constitute in-house value-added resources. Paradoxically, this information source is poorly exploited, as people tend to use external sources (e.g., the Web), although this is probably poorly appropriate in corporate context. This article tackles such information access issues in the common context. Our contribution consists in a faceted visual interface to explore various facets (points of view) of the information of a community, which remains quiescent otherwise. Besides common facets only based on information contents, we propose a new facet relying on the way users in a community manage and organize information. As a result, our approach exploits knowledge workers' efforts devoted to PIS management, turning them to profit for all, by fostering mutual benefit between stakeholders. The proposed facet relies on an original organization-based similarity measure that we define and experiment.",

Study Design and Setting: The SeBriNA is informed by systematic review and bibliometric analysis methodologies. It focuses on two key concepts: 1) quality of evidence for patient-centered outcomes using cumulative meta-analysis and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) appraisal approach; 2) quantity of original research and its citation relationships to related documents. It includes four steps: 1) research questions and document selection; 2) data extraction and analysis; 3) document network relationships; and 4) document network visualization. Results: The primary output from the SeBriNA is an analysis of 1) evidence\u2014the annual cumulative meta-analysis estimate of effect juxtaposed against quality of evidence by patient-centered outcomes (GRADE), and 2) context\u2014the network of relationships between related documents and original research. This analysis can be represented as a single figure. Conclusions: The SeBriNA may help decision makers conceptualize, interpret, and visualize the quantity, quality, and relevance of original research within a network of related documents. Applications include prospective support for clinical and policy decisions and identification of research gaps.",

The overview analysis by data aggregation and country ranking shows that Taiwan has significantly improved its publication productivity and citation impact over the last decade. The drill-down analysis based on journal bibliographic coupling, information visualization, and diversity and trend indexes, reveals that e-Learning and Science Education are two fast growing subfields that attract global interests and that Taiwan is among the top-ranked countries in these two fields in terms of research productivity. Implications of the analysis are discussed with an emphasis on the subfield characteristics from which more insightful interpretations can be obtained, such as the regional or cultural characteristics that may affect the performance ranking.",

In Italy, no register exists that collects clinical data concerning home births.<bold>Objective: </bold>The purpose of this study was (1) to develop a Web portal to collect, through a Web-based form, data on home births in Italy and (2) to provide those interested with a graphic visualization of the analyses and data collected.<bold>Methods: </bold>Following the World Health Organization's guidelines, and adding questions based on scientific evidence, the case report form (CRF) on the online form was drafted by midwives of the National Association of Out-of-Hospital Birth Midwives. During an initial phase, a group of midwives (n=10) tested the CRF, leading to improvements and adding the necessary questions to achieve a CRF that would allow a more complete collection of data. After the test phase, the entire group of midwives (n=166) registered themselves on the system and began filling out birth questionnaires. In a subsequent phase, the administrators of the portal were able to view the completed forms in a graphic format through the use of interactive maps and graphs.<bold>Results: </bold>From 2014 to 2016, 58 midwives included 599 birth questionnaires via the Web portal; of these, 443 were home-based, 76% (321/424) of which were performed at home and 24% (103/424) at a midwifery unit. Most of the births assisted (79%, 335/424) were in northern Italy, and the average ages of the mother and father were 33.6 (SD 4.7) years and 37.0 (SD 5.6) years, respectively.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>We developed an innovative Web-based form that allows, for the first time in Italy, the collection of data on home births and births in the midwifery unit. Furthermore, the data collected are viewable online by the midwives through interactive maps and graphs that allow them to have a general and continuously updated view of the situation of out-of-hospital births performed by the National Association of Out-of-Hospital Birth Midwives. The future goal is to be able to expand this data collection to all out-of-hospital births throughout the national territory. With an increase in the number of enrolled midwives, it would be possible to use the portal as a Web-based form and also as a portal for sharing resources that would help midwives in their clinical practice.",

It is demonstrated that the concept of distance as applied to discriminant analysis provides a unified approach to a wide variety of discriminant analysis procedures that can be accommodated by just changing to an appropriate distance metric. These changes in the distance metric are crucial for the construction of appropriate biplots. Several new types of biplots viz, quadratic discriminant analysis biplots for use with heteroscedastic stratified data, discriminant subspace biplots and flexible discriminant analysis biplots are derived and their use illustrated. Advantages of the proposed procedures are pointed out. Although biplot methodology is in particular well suited for complementing J > 1 classes discrimination problems its use in 2-class problems is also illustrated.",

Since the papers from large geography conferences are an important manifestation of the trending topics and frontiers of geographical research, we break through the limitations of traditional conference reviews through implementation of a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of conference papers. This is of great significance for understanding the subject characteristics and communication modes of academic geography. This article argues that: the American Association of Geographers' Annual Meeting (hereinafter referred to as AAG) and China Conference on Geography (CCG) have both similarities and differences in their characteristics, especially in their focus on specific geographical problems; under the influence of the conference history, academic authority, and institutional culture, AAG and CCG respectively highlight \"globality\" and \"locality\" characteristics, and there are partial common concerns and multiple interweavings on global and local research topics. Compared with AAG's diversified technical applications and sub-discipline development, CCG has neglected humanistic thinking in the empirical bias. With the continuous intersection and integration of different disciplines or areas, the geography of each country in the future should jointly enhance the inclusiveness and openness of academic conferences to promote academic freedom and develop solutions to geographic issues.",

It provides a thorough review to map the quantum of knowledge relating to 'institutional research productivity' correlating the Indian vista. It is, however, indicative to find the gaps and shortcomings in this specialty of research; hence enunciate the issues both attended and unattended. The paper also offers a few recommendations to undertake evaluative studies with caution. Thus it shows a coherent picture of this emerging area in the sociology of science.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Modern neurosurgery is a relatively young discipline characterized by finesse and complexity. In recent years, neurosurgery in China has made continuous developments, with long-term progress and outstanding discoveries in many aspects of the field. Objective: This scientometric investigation aimed to comprehensively provide insight into the development trends of neurosurgery in China, to demonstrate how the field has evolved. Methods: PubMed database was searched to retrieve relevant papers published between 1988 and 2018 from neurosurgery institutions in China. The database of the National Natural Science Foundation of China was also retrieved for funding information. Information (eg, year of publication, journal, institute of origin) and keywords were collected from each paper after removing duplicates and filtering unintentional words. Co-word analysis was performed on the papers' keywords, and a time distribution matrix of coexisting keywords in a given paper (ie, termed co-words) was established. Co-words were clustered according to their growth rate within years and visually presented with a mountain plot and a heatmap. Trends and potential subspecialties were identified, and each topic, represented either by a co-word from publications or funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China during the period from 2011 to 2018, was collected and analyzed. Results: Within 15,972 publications on neurosurgery from institutions in China, diagnostic image was found to coexist the most with other keywords. Cluster 0, represented by diagnostic image with retrospective study, contained emerging topics with great developmental potential and demonstrated high growth rates in recent years. This finding suggests that the topics represented in Cluster 0 may represent future areas of important neurosurgical research. We also found that the developmental trend of China's neurosurgical research is highly correlated with National Natural Science Foundation of China funding acquisition. Conclusions: Co-word analysis and visualization results provided insight into the emerging research topics that are of vital importance, which can be used as a reference by neurosurgeons and researchers for future investigations. In this study, our analysis strategy based on co-word biclustering was able to clearly demonstrate current academic subject development; therefore, co-word biclustering is a reliable bibliometric analysis strategy.

        "Abstract": "When information is known only to friends in a social network, traditional crowdsourcing mechanisms struggle to motivate a large enough user population and to ensure accuracy of the collected information. We thus introduce friendsourcing, a form of crowdsourcing aimed at collecting accurate information available only to a small, socially-connected group of individuals. Our approach to friendsourcing is to design socially enjoyable interactions that produce the desired information as a side effect. We focus our analysis around Collabio, a novel social tagging game that we developed to encourage friends to tag one another within an online social network. Collabio encourages friends, family, and colleagues to generate useful information about each other. We describe the design space of incentives in social tagging games and evaluate our choices by a combination of usage log analysis and survey data. Data acquired via Collabio is typically accurate and augments tags that could have been found on Facebook or the Web. To complete the arc from data collection to application, we produce a trio of prototype applications to demonstrate how Collabio tags could be utilized: an aggregate tag cloud visualization, a personalized RSS feed, and a question and answer system. The social data powering these applications enables them to address needs previously difficult to support, such as question answering for topics comprehensible only to a few of a user's friends.",

        "Abstract": "Peer-review software is often used to allow authors to evaluate their code and its technical text content. In education, peer review is a common practice used not only to evaluate the quality of academic research but also to measure students' engagement in the classroom. In visualization education, numerous researchers have addressed techniques of evaluation; however, such techniques rarely involve students in the evaluation and motivation process, and none have been discussed in the context of visual analytics courses. This study asks how peer-review software designed for student writing may be used in introductory courses to visual analytics at a large state university. To answer this question, this study conducted a questionnaire survey at the School of Information at the University of South Florida in 2016. Reporting on students' experience during the course, the study reveals that the students supported the implementation of visual peer review as an engagement platform from which to understand visual analytics. Future studies need to address whether a new model and software based on visual analytics will better meet the needs of the students and instructors of visual analytics courses.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this research is to present a brief overview of some proposals for portal quality models. In addition, a comparative study is carried out to determine the similarities and differences of these models. Design/methodology/approach: In order to compare the different portal quality models, their main characteristics were analyzed as well as the different dimensions proposed in each model. Findings: As a result, several similarities and differences have been established among the portal quality models. For example, the dimensions present in all the models are navigation, representation, personalization and intrinsic data quality. This means that, as expected, it was found that researchers pay special attention to visual aspects. Practical implications: The comparison attempts to determine which aspects are important for the quality of a web portal, and also to clarify which proposal is the most broadly relevant. The paper also identifies, where necessary, what features must be added in order to ensure that all aspects related to web portal quality are considered. Originality/value: This work tries to identify a portal quality model that can be used to gauge portal quality levels. The model could also be used where there is a low quality level for a particular dimension, giving some guidelines for improving the weaker aspects.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: Many of the existing approaches in Software Comprehension focus on program structure or external documentation. However, by analyzing formal information the informal semantics contained in the vocabulary of source code are overlooked. To understand software as a whole, we need to enrich software analysis with the developer knowledge hidden in the code naming. This paper proposes the use of information retrieval to exploit linguistic information found in source code, such as identifier names and comments. We introduce Semantic Clustering, a technique based on Latent Semantic Indexing and clustering to group source artifacts that use similar vocabulary. We call these groups semantic clusters and we interpret them as linguistic topics that reveal the intention of the code. We compare the topics to each other, identify links between them, provide automatically retrieved labels, and use a visualization to illustrate how they are distributed over the system. Our approach is language independent as it works at the level of identifier names. To validate our approach we applied it on several case studies, two of which we present in this paper. Note: Some of the visualizations presented make heavy use of colors. Please obtain a color copy of the article for better understanding.",

However, the growth in scientific production is not constant. The objective of this work was to analyze the behavior of scientific production in E-learning from a bibliometric perspective in the 2003\u20132015 period, to identify its evolution in relation to other areas of knowledge. The methodology used compared production in E-learning versus world production, production by regions and blocks of countries and production of related areas of knowledge. With these results, a visualization was generated in VOSViewer under the overlay mapping technique to identify the dynamics of the 81 existing scientific journals in the category. This analysis determined that the growth in production in E-learning is due to the contribution of the journals in Social Sciences and that the decrease during the years 2013\u20132015 is mainly due to the fact that Computer Science have decreased their contribution in conference papers and reviews. In conclusion, E-learning is on the decline, since the growth offered by the Social Sciences is not enough to counteract the decline in the contribution of Computer Science. The method used in this study is a contribution to bibliometric techniques to explain the behavior of scientific production in a certain area of knowledge.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Herd immunity or community immunity refers to the reduced risk of infection among susceptible individuals in a population through the presence and proximity of immune individuals. Recent studies suggest that improving the understanding of community immunity may increase intentions to get vaccinated.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aims to design a web application about community immunity and optimize it based on users' cognitive and emotional responses.<bold>Methods: </bold>Our multidisciplinary team developed a web application about community immunity to communicate epidemiological evidence in a personalized way. In our application, people build their own community by creating an avatar representing themselves and 8 other avatars representing people around them, for example, their family or coworkers. The application integrates these avatars in a 2-min visualization showing how different parameters (eg, vaccine coverage, and contact within communities) influence community immunity. We predefined communication goals, created prototype visualizations, and tested four iterative versions of our visualization in a university-based human-computer interaction laboratory and community-based settings (a cafeteria, two shopping malls, and a public library). Data included psychophysiological measures (eye tracking, galvanic skin response, facial emotion recognition, and electroencephalogram) to assess participants' cognitive and affective responses to the visualization and verbal feedback to assess their interpretations of the visualization's content and messaging.<bold>Results: </bold>Among 110 participants across all four cycles, 68 (61.8%) were women and 38 (34.5%) were men (4/110, 3.6%; not reported), with a mean age of 38 (SD 17) years. More than half (65/110, 59.0%) of participants reported having a university-level education. Iterative changes across the cycles included adding the ability for users to create their own avatars, specific signals about who was represented by the different avatars, using color and movement to indicate protection or lack of protection from infectious disease, and changes to terminology to ensure clarity for people with varying educational backgrounds. Overall, we observed 3 generalizable findings. First, visualization does indeed appear to be a promising medium for conveying what community immunity is and how it works. Second, by involving multiple users in an iterative design process, it is possible to create a short and simple visualization that clearly conveys a complex topic. Finally, evaluating users' emotional responses during the design process, in addition to their cognitive responses, offers insights that help inform the final design of an intervention.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Visualization with personalized avatars may help people understand their individual roles in population health. Our app showed promise as a method of communicating the relationship between individual behavior and community health. The next steps will include assessing the effects of the application on risk perception, knowledge, and vaccination intentions in a randomized controlled trial. This study offers a potential road map for designing health communication materials for complex topics such as community immunity.",

        "Abstract": "In this article, we propose mapping and visualizing the core of scientific domains using social network analysis techniques derived from mathematical graph theory. In particular, the concept of Network of the Core is introduced which can be employed to visualize scientific domains by constructing a network among theoretical constructs, models, and concepts. A Network of the Core can be used to reveal hidden properties and structures of a research domain such as connectedness, centrality, density, structural equivalence, and cohesion, by modeling the casual relationship among theoretical constructs. Network of the Core concept can be used to explore the strengths and limitations of a research domain, and graphically and mathematically derive the number research hypotheses. The Network of the Core approach can be applied to any domain given that the investigator has a deep understanding of the area under consideration, a graphical or conceptual view (in the form of a network of association among the theoretical constructs and concepts) of the scientific domain can be obtained, and an underlying theory is available or can be constructed to support Network of the Core formation. Future research directions and several other issues related to the Network of the Core concept are also discussed.",

The publication patterns of a set of researchers were compared before and after receiving RCN awards. These analyses show significant increases in basic collaboration measures--authors per paper and institutions per paper--following RCN support. Various indications suggest increased linkage among the RCN researchers in terms of extent of co-authoring and of cross-citing each other's work. RCN support appears to foster more interdisciplinary research. Diffusion scores (a new metric) showed that the diversity of articles citing RCN-related articles was similar to those citing control group research. Finally, the articles generated by the project activities showed as especially influential; they appear in high impact journals and are more highly cited.",

        "Abstract": "Objective Medical visualization tools have traditionally been constrained to tethered imaging workstations or proprietary client viewers, typically part of hospital radiology systems. To improve accessibility to real-time, remote, interactive, stereoscopic visualization and to enable collaboration among multiple viewing locations, we developed an open source approach requiring only a standard web browser with no added client-side software. Materials and Methods Our collaborative, webbased, stereoscopic, visualization system, CoWebViz, has been used successfully for the past 2 years at the University of Chicago to teach immersive virtual anatomy classes. It is a server application that streams server-side visualization applications to client front-ends, comprised solely of a standard web browser with no added software. Results We describe optimization considerations, usability, and performance results, which make CoWebViz practical for broad clinical use. We clarify technical advances including: enhanced threaded architecture, optimized visualization distribution algorithms, a wide range of supported stereoscopic presentation technologies, and the salient theoretical and empirical network parameters that affect our webbased visualization approach. Discussion The implementations demonstrate usability and performance benefits of a simple web-based approach for complex clinical visualization scenarios. Using this approach overcomes technical challenges that require third-party web browser plug-ins, resulting in the most lightweight client. Conclusions Compared to special software and hardware deployments, unmodified web browsers enhance remote user accessibility to interactive medical visualization. Whereas local hardware and software deployments may provide better interactivity than remote applications, our implementation demonstrates that a simplified, stable, client approach using standard web browsers is sufficient for high quality three-dimensional, stereoscopic, collaborative and interactive visualization.",

        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "The 3D location of skeletal landmarks on CT datasets is an important procedure, used in many research and clinical contexts. The standard procedure involves the segmentation of the CT images, the creation of a 3D surface bone model, and the location of the landmarks on this surface. However, the segmentation is time-consuming and requires skilled operators and sophisticated software. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of a multimodal display interface to direct volumetric interactive visualization in performing a virtual palpation task. An expert operator used the CT dataset of a patient's thigh region to locate 14 femoral skeletal landmarks. This operation was repeatedly performed using different CT data representation; the accuracy and repeatability were compared to those achievable with the conventional procedure based on the segmented 3D surface. When a multimodal display interface (formed by an orthogonal slice, RXCT and interactive isosurface views) was used to perform the virtual palpation directly on the CT data, the average coordinates of the landmarks did not differ significantly from those located on the 3D surface, and the measurement repeatability was actually better with the multimodal display of the volumetric data than with the 3D surface. Thus, we can conclude that skeletal virtual palpation can be performed directly on the CT dataset, as far as the virtual palpation is performed with a multimodal display interface.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: A systematic view of terrorism research to reveal the intellectual structure of the field and empirically discern the distinct set of core researchers, institutional affiliations, publications, and conceptual areas can help us gain a deeper understanding of approaches to terrorism. This paper responds to this need by using an integrated knowledge-mapping framework that we developed to identify the core researchers and knowledge creation approaches in terrorism. The framework uses three types of analysis: (a) basic analysis of scientific output using citation, bibliometric, and social network analyses, (b) content map analysis of large corpora of literature, and (c) co-citation analysis to analyse linkages among pairs of researchers. We applied domain visualization techniques such as content map analysis, block-modeling, and co-citation analysis to the literature and author citation data from the years 1965 to 2003. The data were gathered from ten databases such as the ISI Web of Science. The results reveal: (1) the names of the top 42 core terrorism researchers (e.g., Brian Jenkins, Bruce Hoffman, and Paul Wilkinson) as well as their institutional affiliations; (2) their influential publications; (3) clusters of terrorism researchers who work in similar areas; and (4) that the research focus has shifted from terrorism as a low-intensity conflict to a strategic threat to world powers with increased focus on Osama Bin Laden.",

There are many visualization methods for co-word analysis. However, integration of results by different methods is rarely reported. This article addresses the knowledge gap in this field of study. We compare three visualization methods: Cluster tree, strategy diagram and social network maps, and integrate different results together to one result through co-word analysis of medical informatics. The three visualization methods have their own character: cluster trees show the subject structure, strategic diagrams reveal the importance of topic themes in the structure, and social network maps interpret the internal relationship among themes. Integration of different visualization results to one more readable map complements each other. And it is helpful for researchers to get the concept network and developmental tendency in a certain field.",

        "Abstract": "The decomposition of scientific literature into disciplinary and subdisciplinary structures is one of the core goals of scientometrics. How can we achieve a good decomposition? The ISI subject categories classify journals included in the Science Citation Index (SCI). The aggregated journal-journal citation matrix contained in the Journal Citation Reports can be aggregated on the basis of these categories. This leads to an asymmetrical matrix (citing versus cited) that is much more densely populated than the underlying matrix at the journal level. Exploratory factor analysis of the matrix of subject categories suggests a 14-factor solution. This solution could be interpreted as the disciplinary structure of science. The nested maps of science (corresponding to 14 factors, 172 categories, and 6,164 journals) are online at <URL>http://www.leydesdorff.net/map06</URL>. Presumably, inaccuracies in the attribution of journals to the ISI subject categories average out so that the factor analysis reveals the main structures. The mapping of science could, therefore, be comprehensive and reliable on a large scale albeit imprecise in terms of the attribution of journals to the ISI subject categories.",

We present an exploratory study of children solving a spatial puzzle task. We investigate how the affordances of physical, graphical and tangible interfaces may facilitate the development of thinking skills including mental visualisation, problem space exploration and collaboration. We utilise the theory of complementary actions taken from embodied cognition to develop a video coding methodology that allows us to classify behavioural activity and make inferences about thinking skills development. Our findings indicated that the combination of direct hands-on input style with audio-visual feedback facilitated by the tangible user interface enabled a dynamic task completion strategy, which supports the development of mental skills with a slight time cost. The mouse and graphical user interface supported a trial and error approach, which may limit skills development. The physical cardboard puzzle enabled effective task completion but provided less support for social interaction and problem space exploration. We conclude with design recommendations.",

Patent information plays an important role for innovation-processes and innovators in the knowledge management. The combination of cross-organizational spread information and resources from patent databases and digital libraries is necessary in order to gain profit for innovation experts. The major challenge is to overcome the current information deficit and to fulfill the information need of the experts in the innovation-process. In this paper we first present in detail three innovation scenarios to derive challenges on advanced information systems which support an information dialogue but also the complete search process. Then we define essential conditions of a search task and from that we derive the elementary information sets and activities in the next step. An example shows the applicability and utility of the formalization described and shows how the activities fill up the user\u2019s information dialogue context. During the formalization we apply a cognitive walk-through on a patent database. We will use the Daffodil-system as an experimental system for further development and evaluation of the above described framework.",

Spatial location was determined by semantic content, with inter-object distance representing semantic similarity of documents. The quality of spatial-semantic mapping was manipulated as was the number of dimensions (two versus three) in which document nodes were arranged. Participants were required to browse the information space and identify all documents relevant to a specified topic. Results indicated that participants were able to use three-dimensional spatial mapping of semantic information to facilitate task performance, with performance being better when the quality of the mapping was higher. Strategy differences were identified, with participants adopting a more \u2018exhaustive\u2019 approach when searching two-dimensional node arrangements, and a more \u2018focused\u2019 approach for three-dimensional arrangements. Cognitive ability was not strongly associated with task performance, but participants of relatively lower cognitive ability tended to out-perform those of higher cognitive ability in three-dimensional conditions. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "This paper provides a citation network analysis of publications from the Academy of Management Journal, one of the key US-based journals in the field of Management. Our analysis covers all publications in the journal from 1958-2014. This represents the entire history of the journal until the arbitrary cut-off point of our study. The paper analyses the most published authors, most cited articles, most cited authors, top institutions, and the nationalities of authors that are most represented in the journal. 2304 articles containing 114,550 references were taken from the primary data source, the Web of Science\u2122. An analysis of 114,550 citations was carried out using the Web of Science\u2122 online analytics tool and Excel. Gephi\u2122, a data visualisation and manipulation software, was used to provide a visual representation of the citation networks. Results indicate that the most published authors within AMJ throughout the journal's history are Ivancevich, Golembiewski and Hambrick. The three most cited authors within AMJ are Pfeffer, Porter and Thompson. The single most cited article is Pfeffer and Salancik's 1978 article The external control of organizations: a resource dependence perspective. A keyword analysis revealed that the most important terms used in the journal's history were 'Performance', 'Organization' and 'Work'. Results from this paper extend our previous citation analyses of key journals in the discipline of Higher Education to a new discipline-the field of Management. The paper provides evidence of how visual analyses can help to represent the citation 'geography' of a journal over time.",

The study group consisted of 35 prospective secondary mathematics teachers studying in the mathematics education program at a state university in Turkey. The study was carried out using an embedded design, and the Definite Integral Knowledge Test and an opinion form were used for data collection. Upon analyzing the data, the computer-assisted instruction method using GeoGebra was found to positively contribute to the success of teaching the definite integral topic. Prospective teachers stated that this method should be used in math courses as it creates a fun and interesting environment with dynamic learning elements, provides visualization and opportunities to learn mathematics through practice and exercises, enables thorough understanding and explication of skills, and makes way for conceptual learning instead of memorizing. Furthermore, this study was found to facilitate conceptual learning of the relationship between the lower sum, upper sum and Riemann sum.",

        "Abstract": "This paper provides a brief overview of a number of experimental interface design projects being carried out collaboratively by teams of researchers at the University of Alberta and elsewhere. One goal of this interface research is to explore the principles of rich-prospect browsing interfaces, which I have defined (Ruecker 1) as those where some meaningful representation of every item in a collection is combined with tools for manipulating the display. Often this manipulation is for the purpose of carrying out some portion of a research task: the interfaces lend themselves to exploratory and synthetic activities, such as knowledge discovery and hypothesis formulation. The projects summarized here begin with a browsing prototype originally designed for the task of pill identification (Given et al.). This prototype was subsequently extended into a prototype for browsing conference delegates and other groups of people (Ruecker et al.). Another direction is represented by a nuanced system based on the mandala (Cheypesh et al.) intended for examining any collection that has been encoded with an XML schema. The Mandala Browser uses combinations of \"magnetic axes\" selected by the user from the available tags. Next is the set of specialized interfaces for the Orlando Project (Orlando Team), intended to provide a set of discrete entry points into the deeply-encoded electronic history of women's writing in the British Isles. Our project on tabular interfaces provides a variety of spaces designed to assist the user in using thesauri for multilingual query enhancement (Anvik et al.). The final project described below is NORA (Unsworth), which relies on the power of the D2K data-mining tools at the National Centre for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The goal of NORA is to give humanities scholars a workspace for exploring the system-identified features of common documents and further documents that have been recommended by the system. Each of these projects is discussed within the framework of visualizations involving browsing through dynamic grouping.",

These different values yield a sheaf of increasingly straight lines which together form a cloud of points, being the investigated relation. The theoretical results are tested against the author co-citation relations among 24 informetricians for whom two matrices can be constructed, based on co-citations: the asymmetric occurrence matrix and the symmetric co-citation matrix. Both examples completely confirm the theoretical results. The results enable us to specify an algorithm that provides a threshold value for the cosine above which none of the corresponding Pearson correlations would be negative. Using this threshold value can be expected to optimize the visualization of the vector space.",

This is a challenging enough examination when one considers just U.S. policy where the most popular representations of \"information policy\" are two overly simplified visualizations of complicated knowledge awareness: the food guide pyramid and the terrorist alert notification. Indeed, most of the significant shifts in federal information policy have been part of other laws.

        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Background: Computer tailored, Web-based interventions have emerged as an effective approach to promote physical activity. Existing programs, however, do not adjust activities according to the participant's compliance or physiologic adaptations, which may increase risk of injury and program attrition in sedentary adults. To address this limitation, objective activity monitor (AM) and heart rate data could be used to guide personalization of physical activity, but improved Web-based frameworks are needed to test such interventions. Objective: The objective of this study is to (1) develop a personalized physical activity prescription (PPAP) app that combines dynamic Web-based guidance with multi-sensor AM data to promote physical activity and (2) to assess the feasibility of using this system in the field. Methods: The PPAP app was constructed using an open-source software platform and a custom, multi-sensor AM capable of accurately measuring heart rate and physical activity. A novel algorithm was written to use a participant's compliance and physiologic response to aerobic training (ie, changes in daily resting heart rate) recorded by the AM to create daily, personalized physical activity prescriptions. In addition, the PPAP app was designed to (1) manage the transfer of files from the AM to data processing software and a relational database, (2) provide interactive visualization features such as calendars and training tables to encourage physical activity, and (3) enable remote administrative monitoring of data quality and participant compliance. A 12-week feasibility study was performed to assess the utility and limitations of the PPAP app used by sedentary adults in the field. Changes in physical activity level and resting heart rate were monitored throughout the intervention. Results: The PPAP app successfully created daily, personalized physical activity prescriptions and an interactive Web environment to guide and promote physical activity by the participants. The varied compliance of the participants enabled evaluation of administrative features of the app including the generation of automated email reminders, participation surveys, and daily AM file upload logs. Conclusions: This study describes the development of the PPAP app, a closed-loop technology framework that enables personalized physical activity prescription and remote monitoring of an individual's compliance and health response to the intervention. Data obtained during a 12-week feasibility study demonstrated the ability of the PPAP app to use objective AM data to create daily, personalized physical activity guidance, provide interactive feedback to users, and enable remote administrative monitoring of data quality and subject compliance. Using this approach, public health professionals, clinicians, and researchers can adapt the PPAP app to facilitate a range of personalized physical activity interventions to improve health outcomes, assess injury risk, and achieve fitness performance goals in diverse populations.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: Logic is currently the target of the majority of the upcoming efforts towards the realization of the Semantic Web vision, namely making the content of the Web accessible not only to humans, as it is today, but to machines as well. Defeasible reasoning, a rule-based approach to reasoning with incomplete and conflicting information, is a powerful tool in many Semantic Web applications. Despite its strong mathematical background, logic, in general, and defeasible logic, in particular, may overload the user with tons of additional complex semantic relationships among data and metadata of the Semantic Web. To this end, a comprehensible, visual representation of these semantic relationships (rules) would help users understand them and make more use of them. This paper presents VDR-DEVICE, a defeasible reasoning system, designed specifically for the Semantic Web environment. VDR-DEVICE is an integrated development environment for deploying and visualizing defeasible logic rule bases on top of RDF Schema ontologies. The system consists of a number of sub-components, which, though developed autonomously, are combined efficiently, forming a flexible framework. The system employs a defeasible reasoning system that supports direct importing and processing of RDF data and RDF Schema ontologies as well as a number of user-friendly rule base and ontology visualization modules.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Background: Target identification is important for modern drug discovery. With the advances in the development of molecular docking, potential binding proteins may be discovered by docking a small molecule to a repository of proteins with three-dimensional (3D) structures. To complete this task, a reverse docking program and a drug target database with 3D structures are necessary. To this end, we have developed a web server tool, TarFisDock (Target Fishing Docking) http://www.dddc.ac.cn/tarfisdock, which has been used widely by others. Recently, we have constructed a protein target database, Potential Drug Target Database (PDTD), and have integrated PDTD with TarFisDock. This combination aims to assist target identification and validation. Description: PDTD is a web-accessible protein database for in silico target identification. It currently contains >1100 protein entries with 3D structures presented in the Protein Data Bank. The data are extracted from the literatures and several online databases such as TTD, DrugBank and Thomson Pharma. The database covers diverse information of >830 known or potential drug targets, including protein and active sites structures in both PDB and mol2 formats, related diseases, biological functions as well as associated regulating (signaling) pathways. Each target is categorized by both nosology and biochemical function. PDTD supports keyword search function, such as PDB ID, target name, and disease name. Data set generated by PDTD can be viewed with the plug-in of molecular visualization tools and also can be downloaded freely. Remarkably, PDTD is specially designed for target identification. In conjunction with TarFisDock, PDTD can be used to identify binding proteins for small molecules. The results can be downloaded in the form of mol2 file with the binding pose of the probe compound and a list of potential binding targets according to their ranking scores. Conclusion: PDTD serves as a comprehensive and unique repository of drug targets. Integrated with TarFisDock, PDTD is a useful resource to identify binding proteins for active compounds or existing drugs. Its potential applications include in silico drug target identification, virtual screening, and the discovery of the secondary effects of an old drug (i.e. new pharmacological usage) or an existing target (i.e. new pharmacological or toxic relevance), thus it may be a valuable platform for the pharmaceutical researchers. PDTD is available online at http://www.dddc.ac.cn/pdtd/.",

The methodology is partly based on the 'issue management' approach by Lancaster and Lee (J Assoc Inf Sci Technol 36(6):389-397, 1985) partly on common publication and citation analysis of the set of source documents (n\u2009=\u20094725), the set of their references (n\u2009=\u200927,099) and the set of publications (n\u2009=\u20097863) citing the source documents. Median age analyses are included for the sets of references and citations to the source documents. DIVA-like diagrams (Database Information Visualization and Analysis system) are used to demonstrate the distribution of source documents over document types, time and volume of citations obtained. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is applied to topic modeling of the top-100 central WoS Categories of 'smart city(ies)' research and to the set of references. Findings show that the first mention of the concept 'smart city(ies)' in publication titles takes place in 1999. The research area demonstrates a strong multidisciplinary nature and an exponential growth of research publications (in WoS) 2008-2016 dominated by China, Italy, USA, Spain and England. The same five countries are also among the most citing and cited countries. Aside from a constantly strong ICT (Information and Communication Technology) and Electrical/Electronic Engineering presence 'sustainability' elements (Energy, Transport, Environment) are also vital, in particular during the first and third analysis period. The references from the source documents have more distinct topical clusters than the source documents. Artificial Intelligence (AI) appears as a novel field among the source documents 2008-2016, but disappears from the top-25 list in the citing documents. Instead Economics, Water Resources and Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences move into the list. Proceedings papers, as in many other engineering and technology based research fields, are the dominant document type (70%) but have small citation impact (0.6\u00a0c/p), thus decreasing the overall impact of the area to 3.6\u00a0c/p. Journal articles are the most cited type with 76% of all citations received (impact 2008-2016: 7.5\u00a0c/p). Most citations to journal articles derive from journal articles themselves (76%).",

In the process, we consider the app's interface and its functionalities, along with the discourse around it, including reviews. The latter in particular are highly revealing of how, despite disclaimers in promotional and other related materials, the apps and their makers are held to precisely the sort of evidentiary standards that they are seeking to break away from. In looking for explanations, we relate those reactions to conventions for the selection and representation of data that producers of (all) visualizations rely on.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge about the structure and organization of criminal networks is important for both crime investigation and the development of effective strategies to prevent crimes. However, except for network visualization, criminal network analysis remains primarily a manual process. Existing tools do not provide advanced structural analysis techniques that allow extraction of network knowledge from large volumes of criminal-justice data. To help law enforcement and intelligence agencies discover criminal network knowledge efficiently and effectively, in this research we proposed a framework for automated network analysis and visualization. The framework included four stages: network creation, network partition, structural analysis, and network visualization. Based upon it, we have developed a system called CrimeNet Explorer that incorporates several advanced techniques: a concept space approach, hierarchical clustering, social network analysis methods, and multidimensional scaling. Results from controlled experiments involving student subjects demonstrated that our system could achieve higher clustering recall and precision than did untrained subjects when detecting subgroups from criminal networks. Moreover, subjects identified central members and interaction patterns between groups significantly faster with the help of structural analysis functionality than with only visualization functionality. No significant gain in effectiveness was present, however. Our domain experts also reported that they believed CrimeNet Explorer could be very useful in crime investigation.",

We present a framework for analysing large collections of user generated content. This involves classification of descriptive terms attached by users to photographs into facets of elements, qualities, and activities. We apply this framework to two contrasting photographic archives -- Flickr and Geograph, representing weakly and strongly moderated content respectively. We propose a method for removing user-generated bias from such collections though the user of term profiles that can assess the effect of the most and least prolific contributors to a collection. Analysis and visualization of co-occurrence between terms suggests clear differences in the description of place between the two collections, both in terms of the facets used and their geographical footprints. This is attributed to the role of moderation/editorialising of content; to the role tags and free--text have on descriptive behaviour and to the geographic footprint of content supplied by the two collections.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge representation (KR) can be defined as a set of ontological commitments, provided with the capabilities of performing inference. The knowledge can be represented using an ontology, which provides a shared insight into a certain domain. The use of ontologies to represent knowledge also allows interoperation among knowledge-based systems. The process of building ontologies can be tedious and sometimes exhaustive. A possible solution in order to avoid this problem would be to reuse the ontologies previously created by others. This paper describes a case study of reusability using OWL-VisMod, a tool designed for developing ontological engineering based on visual conceptual modelling for OWL ontologies. A workflow performed with OWL-VisMod is described; including a decision-making process in order to decide whether or not it could be desirable to reuse an ontology, according to the requirements of a certain project.",

We find that biomass publications are intensively distributed in developed regions and some emerging economies. The U.S. leads in this emerging field as evidenced by research quantity, impact, and international collaboration links. China is developing rapidly in this domain in terms of publication volume and collaborative links but suffers from low research visibility.

        "Abstract": "In a previous study of patent classifications in nine material technologies for photovoltaic cells, Leydesdorff et al. (Scientometrics 102(1):629-651, ) reported cyclical patterns in the longitudinal development of Rao-Stirling diversity. We suggested that these cyclical patterns can be used to indicate technological life-cycles. Upon decomposition, however, the cycles are exclusively due to increases and decreases in the variety of the classifications, and not to disparity or technological distance, measured as (1 \u2212 cosine). A single frequency component can accordingly be shown in the periodogram. Furthermore, the cyclical patterns are associated with the numbers of inventors in the respective technologies. Sometimes increased variety leads to a boost in the number of inventors, but in early phases-when the technology is still under construction-it can also be the other way round. Since the development of the cycles thus seems independent of technological distances among the patents, the visualization in terms of patent maps, can be considered as addressing an analytically different set of research questions.",

However, there is a large overlap between their meanings and relationships. With an increasing concern for both SC and RC in urban development and hazard mitigation, a review was conducted to explore the differences and connections between SC and RC with scientometric analysis. There are far more literatures about SC than RC, and very few papers discuss SC and RC together. The research trend, category, and hotspots from research clusters are illustrated and compared. Major differences are discussed from their objectives, driving force, current research focus, and criticism. The literatures both related to SC and RC are used to explore their connections, which are very limited. The results revealed that the RC's impact on SC are positive from physical, social, and environmental aspects, while SC's impacts on RC could be both positive and negative from the above three aspects. It is indicated that SC and RC are both important for urban planning and can be complementary to each other through proper design and governance, which implies the need for building a resilient smart city (RSC).

        "Abstract": "The World Wide Web is today the largest information seeking environment. Millions of people use it to satisfy their information needs. Although it is quite easy for able-bodied users to use it, there are still a lot of problems for people with disabilities. A major group of them are blind users. Blind users navigate the web in a different and less effective and efficient way especially when it comes to information seeking tasks. To ease the problem we introduced the Browsing Shortcuts (BSs) mechanism to enable blind people to move efficiently to various elements of a web page (e.g. functional elements such as forms, navigational aids, etc.), hence operating effectively as an interaction method and a vital counterbalance to low navigability of web pages. Although there are proofs that navigation performance was improved using the BSs mechanism, this effect had never been examined and explained in detail. In this paper, we re-analyse data collected from past experiments and review BSs usage from a navigation behaviour perspective. This is achieved by a new analysis using a visualisation method of \u201ctravel graphs\u201d for studying the navigation methods of blind users. We compare behaviours of blind users using the BSs feature to the ones used without it to determine changes in behaviour. The basic aim behind this analysis is to examine how BSs have affected the navigation behaviour of blind users. We wished to determine how non-visual navigation using BSs assists users in parsing a web page into functional or semantic regions. Additionally, we wished to examine if and how these regions are accessed during an information seeking episode with and without the BSs mechanism. Finally, we wished to examine whether these changes are towards more rationalised information seeking behaviour. In overall, this new analysis of the recorded results indicate that the navigation model using BSs signifies more rationalised navigation and significantly change information seeking behaviour improving both navigability and information seeking performance.",

        "Abstract": "Background and objective Doc'CISMeF (DC) is a semantic search engine used to find resources in CISMeF-BP, a quality controlled health gateway, which gathers guidelines available on the internet in French. Visualization of Concepts in Medicine (VCM) is an iconic language that may ease information retrieval tasks. This study aimed to describe the creation and evaluation of an interface integrating VCM in DC in order to make this search engine much easier to use. Methods Focus groups were organized to suggest ways to enhance information retrieval tasks using VCM in DC. A VCM interface was created and improved using the ergonomic evaluation approach. 20 physicians were recruited to compare the VCM interface with the non- VCM one. Each evaluator answered two different clinical scenarios in each interface. The ability and time taken to select a relevant resource were recorded and compared. A usability analysis was performed using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results The VCM interface contains a filter based on icons, and icons describing each resource according to focus group recommendations. Some ergonomic issues were resolved before evaluation. Use of VCM significantly increased the success of information retrieval tasks (OR=11; 95% CI 1.4 to 507). Nonetheless, it took significantly more time to find a relevant resource with VCM interface (101 vs 65 s; p=0.02). SUS revealed 'good' usability with an average score of 74/100. Conclusions VCM was successfully implemented in DC as an option. It increased the success rate of information retrieval tasks, despite requiring slightly more time, and was well accepted by end-users.",

        "Abstract": "Large scale research Digital Libraries (DLs) have a large array of potentially useful metadata. Yet, many popular DLs do not provide a convenient way to navigate the metadata or to visualize classification schema in the user session. For example, in the broad world of Management Information Systems (MIS) research, a high-level overview of MIS topics and their inter-relationships would be useful to navigate a MIS DL before zooming in on a specific article. To address this obstacle, this paper describes a prototype, the Technical Report Visualizer System (TRV), which uses a wide variety of open standards to expose DL classification metadata in the navigation interface. The system captures MIS article metadata from the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) compliant arXiv e-Print archive at Cornell University. The OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is used to collect the topic metadata; the articles' Association for Computing Machinery's (ACM) Computing Classification System codes. We display the topic metadata in a Java hyperbolic tree and make use of XML conceptual product and implementation product standards and specifications, such as the Dublin Core and BiblioML bibliographic metadata sets, XML Topic Maps, Xalan and Xerces, to link user navigation activity to the abstracts and full text contents of the articles. We discuss the flexibility and convenience of XML standards and link this effort to related digital library visualization approaches.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to explore graduate students' behaviour and perspectives regarding personal digital document management, as well as insights into the connections between memory and document re-finding. Design/methodology/approach -- Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 graduate students studying information and library science. The interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. The transcripts were analysed using open and axial coding. Findings -- Participants were overall positive about the importance of managing their digital documents but they had little knowledge about currently available personal information management (PIM) tools. Characteristics of digital documents frequently used by participants to re-find documents include name, subject, storage location, creation time, keyword, document title, document file type, user's location and recency. For participants the act of organizing documents is itself a memory aid. Participants' recommendations for PIM tools include support for information organization and simplistic visualizations that can be customized, e.g., using colour to highlight folders or documents. Research limitations/implications -- The number of study participants was relatively small, and further studies should examine a more diverse participant sample, e.g., to investigate whether tasks influence re-finding. Further studies should also examine PIM with respect to other types of devices and services, including tablets and cloud services. Practical implications -- The results include recommendations for future PIM tool design. Originality/value -- This research identifies documents' characteristics that participants use to re-find documents and the importance of these characteristics. It also examines the usage and expectations of PIM tools in everyday PIM.",

        "Abstract": "Background: The increasing ownership of smartphones provides major opportunities for epidemiological research through self-reported and passively collected data. Objective: This pilot study aimed to codesign a smartphone app to assess associations between weather and joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to study the success of daily self-reported data entry over a 60-day period and the enablers of and barriers to data collection. Methods: A patient and public involvement group (n=5) and 2 focus groups of patients with RA (n=9) supported the codesign of the app collecting self-reported symptoms. A separate \"capture app\" was designed to collect global positioning system (GPS) and continuous raw accelerometer data, with the GPS-linking providing local weather data. A total of 20 patients with RA were then recruited to collect daily data for 60 days, with entry and exit interviews. Of these, 17 were loaned an Android smartphone, whereas 3 used their own Android smartphones. Results: Of the 20 patients, 6 (30%) withdrew from the study: 4 because of technical challenges and 2 for health reasons. The mean completion of daily entries was 68% over 2 months. Patients entered data at least five times per week 65% of the time. Reasons for successful engagement included a simple graphical user interface, automated reminders, visualization of data, and eagerness to contribute to this easily understood research question. The main barrier to continuing engagement was impaired battery life due to the accelerometer data capture app. For some, successful engagement required ongoing support in using the smartphones. Conclusions: This successful pilot study has demonstrated that daily data collection using smartphones for health research is feasible and achievable with high levels of ongoing engagement over 2 months. This result opens important opportunities for large-scale longitudinal epidemiological research.",

We also present the first study that compares different aspects using an autostereoscopic display with AR and virtual reality (VR), in which 39 children from 8 to 10 years old participated. In our study, no statistically significant differences were found between AR and VR. However, the scores were very high in nearly all of the questions, and the children also scored the AR version higher in all cases. Moreover, the children explicitly preferred the AR version (81%). For the AR version, a strong and significant correlation was found between the use of the autostereoscopic screen in games and seeing the virtual object on the marker. For the VR version, two strong and significant correlations were found. The first correlation was between the ease of play and the use of the rotatory controller. The second correlation was between depth perception and the game global score. Therefore, the combinations of AR and VR with autostereoscopic visualisation are possibilities for developing edutainment systems for children.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Medication misuse results in considerable problems for both patient and society. It is a complex problem with many contributing factors, including timely access to product information. Objective: To investigate the value of 3-dimensional (3D) visualization paired with video conferencing as a tool for pharmaceutical advice over distance in terms of accessibility and ease of use for the advice seeker. Methods: We created a Web-based communication service called AssistancePlus that allows an advisor to demonstrate the physical handling of a complex pharmaceutical product to an advice seeker with the aid of 3D visualization and audio/video conferencing. AssistancePlus was tested in 2 separate user studies performed in a usability lab, under realistic settings and emulating a real usage situation. In the first study, 10 pharmacy students were assisted by 2 advisors from the Swedish National Co-operation of Pharmacies' call centre on the use of an asthma inhaler. The student-advisor interview sessions were filmed on video to qualitatively explore their experience of giving and receiving advice with the aid of 3D visualization. In the second study, 3 advisors from the same call centre instructed 23 participants recruited from the general public on the use of 2 products: (1) an insulin injection pen, and (2) a growth hormone injection syringe. First, participants received advice on one product in an audio-recorded telephone call and for the other product in a video-recorded AssistancePlus session (product order balanced). In conjunction with the AssistancePlus session, participants answered a questionnaire regarding accessibility, perceived expressiveness, and general usefulness of 3D visualization for advice-giving over distance compared with the telephone and were given a short interview focusing on their experience of the 3D features. Results: In both studies, participants found the AssistancePlus service helpful in providing clear and exact instructions. In the second study, directly comparing AssistancePlus and the telephone, AssistancePlus was judged positively for ease of communication (P = .001), personal contact (P = .001), explanatory power (P < .001), and efficiency (P < .001). Participants in both studies said that they would welcome this type of service as an alternative to the telephone and to face-to-face interaction when a physical meeting is not possible or not convenient. However, although AssistancePlus was considered as easy to use as the telephone, they would choose AssistancePlus over the telephone only when the complexity of the question demanded the higher level of expressiveness it offers. For simpler questions, a simpler service was preferred. Conclusions: 3D visualization paired with video conferencing can be useful for advice-giving over distance, specifically for issues that require a higher level of communicative expressiveness than the telephone can offer. 3D-supported advice-giving can increase the range of issues that can be handled over distance and thus improve access to product information.",

        "Abstract": "Based on articles published in 1990\u20132004 in 21 library and information science (LIS) journals, a set of cocitation analyses was performed to study changes in research fronts over the last 15 years, where LIS is at now, and to discuss where it is heading. To study research fronts, here defined as current and influential cocited articles, a citations among documents methodology was applied; and to study changes, the analyses were time-sliced into three 5-year periods. The results show a stable structure of two distinct research fields: informetrics and information seeking and retrieval (ISR). However, experimental retrieval research and user oriented research have merged into one ISR field; and IR and informetrics also show signs of coming closer together, sharing research interests and methodologies, making informetrics research more visible in mainstream LIS research. Furthermore, the focus on the Internet, both in ISR research and in informetrics\u2014where webometrics quickly has become a dominating research area\u2014is an important change. The future is discussed in terms of LIS dependency on technology, how integration of research areas as well as technical systems can be expected to continue to characterize LIS research, and how webometrics will continue to develop and find applications.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Body listening, described as the act of paying attention to the body's signals and cues, can be an important component of long-term health management.<bold>Objective: </bold>The aim of this study was to introduce and evaluate the Body Listening Project, an innovative effort to engage the public in the creation of a public resource-to leverage collective wisdom in the health domain. This project involved a website where people could contribute their experiences of and dialogue with others concerning body listening and self-management. This article presents an analysis of the tags contributed, with a focus on the value of these tags for knowledge organization and incorporation into consumer-friendly health information retrieval systems.<bold>Methods: </bold>First, we performed content analysis of the tags contributed, identifying a set of categories and refining the relational structure of the categories to develop a preliminary classification scheme, the Body Listening and Self-Management Taxonomy. Second, we compared the concepts in the Body Listening and Self-Management Taxonomy with concepts that were automatically identified from an extant health knowledge resource, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), to better characterize the information that participants contributed. Third, we employed visualization techniques to explore the concept space of the tags. A correlation matrix, based on the extent to which categories tended to be assigned to the same tags, was used to study the interrelatedness of the taxonomy categories. Then a network visualization was used to investigate structural relationships among the categories in the taxonomy.<bold>Results: </bold>First, we proposed a taxonomy called the Body Listening and Self-Management Taxonomy, with four meta-level categories: (1) health management strategies, (2) concepts and states, (3) influencers, and (4) health-related information behavior. This taxonomy could inform future efforts to organize knowledge and content of this subject matter. Second, we compared the categories from this taxonomy with the UMLS concepts that were identified. Though the UMLS offers benefits such as speed and breadth of coverage, the Body Listening and Self-Management Taxonomy is more consumer-centric. Third, the correlation matrix and network visualization demonstrated that there are natural areas of ambiguity and semantic relatedness in the meanings of the concepts in the Body Listening and Self-Management Taxonomy. Use of these visualizations can be helpful in practice settings, to help library and information science practitioners understand and resolve potential challenges in classification; in research, to characterize the structure of the conceptual space of health management; and in the development of consumer-centric health information retrieval systems.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>A participatory platform can be employed to collect data concerning patient experiences of health management, which can in turn be used to develop new health knowledge resources or augment existing ones, as well as be incorporated into consumer-centric health information systems.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Antibiotic misuse is a serious public health problem worldwide. National health authorities release clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to guide general practitioners (GPs) in their choice of antibiotics. However, despite the large-scale dissemination of CPGs, GPs continue to prescribe antibiotics that are not recommended as first-line treatments. This nonadherence to recommendations may be due to GPs misunderstanding the CPGs. A web interface displaying antibiotic prescription recommendations and their justifications could help to improve the comprehensibility and readability of CPGs, thereby increasing the adoption of recommendations regarding antibiotic treatment.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aims to design and evaluate a web interface for antibiotic prescription displaying both the recommended antibiotics and their justifications in the form of antibiotic properties.<bold>Methods: </bold>A web interface was designed according to the same principles as e-commerce interfaces and was assessed by 117 GPs. These GPs were asked to answer 17 questions relating to the usefulness, user-friendliness, and comprehensibility and readability of the interface, and their satisfaction with it. Responses were recorded on a 4-point Likert scale (ranging from \"absolutely disagree\" to \"absolutely agree\"). At the end of the evaluation, the GPs were allowed to provide optional, additional free comments.<bold>Results: </bold>The antibiotic prescription web interface consists of three main sections: a clinical summary section, a filter section, and a recommended antibiotics section. The majority of GPs appreciated the clinical summary (90/117, 76.9%) and filter (98/117, 83.8%) sections, whereas 48.7% (57/117) of them reported difficulty reading some of the icons in the recommended antibiotics section. Overall, 82.9% (97/117) of GPs found the display of drug properties useful, and 65.8% (77/117) reported that the web interface improved their understanding of CPG recommendations.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The web interface displaying antibiotic recommendations and their properties can help doctors understand the rationale underlying CPG recommendations regarding antibiotic treatment, but further improvements are required before its implementation into a clinical decision support system.",

        "Sub_Type": "journal article",
        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>The financial relationship between physicians and industries has become a hotly debated issue globally. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act of the US Affordable Care Act (2010) promoted transparency of the transactions between industries and physicians by making remuneration data publicly accessible in the Open Payments Program database. Meanwhile, according to the World Health Organization, the majority of all noncommunicable disease deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aimed to investigate the distribution of non-research and non-ownership payments made to thoracic surgeons, to explore the regularity of financial relationships between industries and thoracic surgeons.<bold>Methods: </bold>Annual statistical data were obtained from the Open Payments Program general payment dataset from 2014-2016. We characterized the distribution of annual payments with single payment transactions greater than US $10,000, quantified the major expense categories (eg, Compensation, Consulting Fees, Travel and Lodging), and identified the 30 highest-paying industries. Moreover, we drew out the financial relations between industries to thoracic surgeons using chord diagram visualization.<bold>Results: </bold>The three highest categories with single payments greater than US $10,000 were Royalty or License, Compensation, and Consulting Fees. Payments related to Royalty or License transferred from only 5.38% of industries to 0.75% of surgeons with the highest median (US $13,753, $11,992, and $10,614 respectively) in 3-year period. In contrast, payments related to Food and Beverage transferred from 93.50% of industries to 98.48% of surgeons with the lowest median (US $28, $27, and $27). The top 30 highest-paying industries made up approximately 90% of the total payments (US $21,036,972, $23,304,996, and $28,116,336). Furthermore, just under 9% of surgeons received approximately 80% of the total payments in each of the 3 years. Specifically, the 100 highest cumulative payments, accounting for 52.69% of the total, transferred from 27 (6.05%) pharmaceutical industries to 86 (1.89%) thoracic surgeons from 2014-2016; 7 surgeons received payments greater than US $1,000,000; 12 surgeons received payments greater than US $400,000. The majority (90%) of these surgeons received tremendous value from only one industry.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>There exists a great discrepancy in the distribution of payments by categories. Royalty or License Fees, Compensation, and Consulting Fees are the primary transferring channels of single large payments. The massive transfer from industries to surgeons has a strong \"apical dominance\" and excludability. Further research should focus on discovering the fundamental driving factors for the strong concentration of certain medical devices and how these payments will affect the industry itself.",

However, its great time and space complexity limits its use in real-time applications and in networks of any considerable size. The present work describes an improved algorithm with considerably reduced time and space complexity. Its lower execution costs thus increase its applicability both in real time and to large networks.",

        "Abstract": "Categorized overviews of web search results are a promising way to support user exploration, understanding, and discovery. These search interfaces combine a metadata-based overview with the list of search results to enable a rich form of interaction. A study of 24 sophisticated users carrying out complex tasks suggests how searchers may adapt their search tactics when using categorized overviews. This mixed methods study evaluated categorized overviews of web search results organized into thematic, geographic, and government categories. Participants conducted four exploratory searches during a 2-hour session to generate ideas for newspaper articles about specified topics such as \u201chuman smuggling.\u201d Results showed that subjects explored deeper while feeling more organized, and that the categorized overview helped subjects better assess their results, although no significant differences were detected in the quality of the article ideas. A qualitative analysis of searcher comments identified seven tactics that participants reported adopting when using categorized overviews. This paper concludes by proposing a set of guidelines for the design of exploratory search interfaces. An understanding of the impact of categorized overviews on search tactics will be useful to web search researchers, search interface designers, information architects and web developers.",

Historians and social scientists believe that e-mail archives are important artifacts for understanding the individuals and communities they represent. To understand the conversations evidenced in an archive, context is needed. In this article, we present a new way to gain this necessary context: analyzing the temporal rhythms of social relationships. We provide methods for constructing meaningful rhythms from the e-mail headers by identifying relationships and interpreting their attributes. With these visualization techniques, e-mail archive explorers can uncover insights that may have been otherwise hidden in the archive. We apply our methods to an individual's 15-year e-mail archive, which consists of about 45,000 messages and over 4,000 relationships.",

Organisations have access to unreadable volumes of textual data and yet individuals are required to make sense of emerging practices and events from this blizzard of information. Tools that provide an overview of unstructured information to aid higher level understanding are now easily available. Researchers highlight two aspects of sense-making that come into play. First, the organisation struggles to make sense of what it does and what it does not know in the context of a surfeit of information. Second, in order to exploit appropriate tools in this process, the organisation must also make sense of the value and use of these tools.",

We then apply that framework to integrate domain-specific (archeological) DLs, illustrating our solutions for key problems in DL integration. An integrated Archeological DL, ETANA-DL, is used as a case study to justify and evaluate our DL integration approach. More specifically, we develop a minimal metamodel for archeological DLs within the 5S theory. We implement the 5SSuite tool set to cover the process of union DL generation, including requirements gathering, conceptual modeling, rapid prototyping, and code generation. 5SSuite consists of 5SGraph, 5SGen, and SchemaMapper, each of which plays an important role in DL integration. We also propose an approach to integrated DLs based on the 5S formalism, which provides a systematic method to design and implement DL exploring services.",

Of the 17,109 papers retrieved 76.9 % were in collaboration, with 34.3 % of these involving foreign institutions. We analysed the collaboration links with foreign partners using visualizations and their dynamics by determining the combination and frequency of individual occurrences and by establishing the sequence found in our country co-authorship chains. Bilateral partnerships were the most common predominantly with the USA and to the lesser extent with Spain. These two countries are also the protagonists of the most frequent trilateral co-authorships. Collaboration with other Latin American countries is infrequent and mainly bilateral. The number of partner countries increased from 75 to 92 from the first to the second quinquennium. With respect to the countries emerging in the second period we find a greater occurrence and repetition of bilateral partnerships and a notable presence of Mexico's main industrialised partners in the corresponding chains. Similar numbers of journals were found for national and international collaborative papers with important differences but several coincidences. The subject range of journals was diverse in both cases, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the field but with an important presence of titles specializing in subfields of Chemistry. Our findings provide new insight into the way countries interact and communicate when co-authoring with developing countries.",

        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Background: Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) represents a promising method for benefit-risk assessment. Our goal was to develop features of pragmatic MCDA (EVIDEM [Evidence and Value: Impact on DEcisionMaking]) addressing real-life regulatory decision-making needs, incorporate advanced pharmacoepidemiology, and test the resulting benefit-risk framework using a case study. Methods: The Intervention Outcomes domain of EVIDEM was transformed into a generic benefit-risk framework including clinical efficacy, patient-reported outcomes, and adverse event (AE) criteria. The concept of relative benefit-risk balance (RBRB) was developed for comparability across products and therapeutic areas and over time. Evidence matrix was designed to include most relevant data from trials, observational studies, and models, including Bayesian and longitudinal modeling. The framework was tested with a panel of stakeholders using efalizumab for psoriasis as retrospective case study. Uncertainty was explored. Results: The MCDA benefit-risk tree was adapted with psoriasis-specific subcriteria. Panelists assigned similar weights to benefits (0.48; SD, 0.20-0.70) and risks (0.52; SD, 0.10-0.60), with large variations reflecting diverse perspectives. Panelist scores reflected higher efficacy versus placebo, lower efficacy versus active comparators, and serious and fatal AEs identified postlicensing. Efalizumab\u2019s RBRB was positive at licensing in 2004 (0.29, scale \u20131 to +1) and ranged from \u20130.41 (vs active comparators) to 0.01 (vs placebo) in 2009, when its market authorization was withdrawn. Retesting indicated good reproducibility. Panelists acknowledged good face validity and the importance of criteria beyond benefit-risk in real-life assessments. Conclusions: The approach allows quantification and visualization of benefit-risk over time and across comparators. Combination of pragmatic MCDA designed to integrate criteria beyond benefit-risk and advanced statistics supports application of MCDA to further accountable benefit-risk assessments for real-life decision making.",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 This study developed a program and an online questionnaire to collect the data set from Facebook, and then integrated that data set with a subjective data set consisting of participants' opinions of the strength of their friendships on Facebook. The model developed here for predicting tie strength performed well when was applied on a data set of 6,477 SNSs' ties, distinguishing between strong and weak ties with over 50 percent accuracy. Findings \u2013 The results developed an algorithm (predictive model) that quantifies and measures tie strength continuously to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The results found that the variables in the dimension of emotional intensity had stronger effects than other interaction variables. Originality/value \u2013 This study developed a predictive model that helps explain the meaning of interaction on SNSs, providing an efficient method to examine tie strength on SNSs. The tie strength estimates can also be used to improve the range and performance of various aspects of SNSs, including link predictions, product recommendations, newsfeeds, people searches, and visualization. Such understanding of the structure of SNSs might lead ultimately to the design of algorithms that can detect trusted or influential users of SNSs.",

Design/methodology/approach -- Using a literature review, internal and external conversations, several collections pilot projects, and a variety of other investigative mechanisms, this paper explores methods for creating a more flexible, holistic collection development and assessment model using both qualitative and quantitative data. Findings -- The products of scholarship that academic libraries include in their collections are expanding exponentially and range from journals and monographs in all formats, to databases, data sets, digital text and images, streaming media, visualizations and animations. Content is also being shared in new ways and on a variety of platforms. Yet the framework for evaluating this new landscape of scholarly output is in its infancy. So, how do libraries develop and assess collections in a consistent, holistic, yet agile, manner? Libraries must employ a variety of mechanisms to ensure this goal, while remaining flexible in adapting to the shifting collections environment. Originality/value -- In so much as the authors are aware, this is the first paper to examine an agile, holistic approach to collections using both qualitative and quantitative data.",

        "Abstract": "Context is a determining factor in language and plays a decisive role in polysemic words. Several psycholinguistically motivated algorithms have been proposed to emulate human management of context, under the assumption that the value of a word is evanescent and takes on meaning only in interaction with other structures. The predication algorithm (Kintsch, <BIBR>2001</BIBR>), for example, uses a vector representation of the words produced by LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) to dynamically simulate the comprehension of predications and even of predicative metaphors. The objective of this study was to predict some unwanted effects that could be present in vector-space models when extracting different meanings of a polysemic word (predominant meaning inundation, lack of precision, and low-level definition), and propose ideas based on the predication algorithm for avoiding them. Our first step was to visualize such unwanted phenomena and also the effect of solutions. We use different methods to extract the meanings for a polysemic word (without context, vector sum, and predication algorithm). Our second step was to conduct an analysis of variance to compare such methods and measure the impact of potential solutions. Results support the idea that a human-based computational algorithm like the predication algorithm can take into account features that ensure more accurate representations of the structures we seek to extract. Theoretical assumptions and their repercussions are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Although there is a growing need for Content-Based Image Retrieval systems, their use is often hampered by significant computational complexity and their inability to explain to their users the reasoning behind the similarity and retrieval processes they employ. This paper introduces Turning Function Difference (TFD), an efficient novel shape-matching method, which is based on the curvature of the shape outline and is translation, rotation and scale invariant. The method produces information about the correspondence of points belonging to the compared shapes that are used during the explanation process. TFD explains its results through an alignment and a visual animation process that highlights the similarities between the model images and each one of the selected images as perceived by the method. The proposed shape-matching method is used in the G Computer Vision (GCV) library, a single-object image retrieval system that utilizes information about the objects' outlines and explains the reasoning behind the selection of similar images to the user. The implemented system is freely available for download to all interested users.",

Personalized and social learning have been suggested as potential ways to address these problems. Our work presented in this paper combines the ideas of personalized and social learning in the context of educational hypermedia. We introduce Progressor, an innovative Web-based tool based on the concepts of social navigation and open student modeling that helps students to find the most relevant resources in a large collection of parameterized self-assessment questions on Java programming. We have evaluated Progressor in a semester-long classroom study, the results of which are presented in this paper. The study confirmed the impact of personalized social navigation support provided by the system in the target context. The interface encouraged students to explore more topics attempting more questions and achieving higher success rates in answering them. A deeper analysis of the social navigation support mechanism revealed that the top students successfully led the way to discovering most relevant resources by creating clear pathways for weaker students.",

DESIGN: The authors studied the various guidelines used to write the pharmacodynamics section of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for antibiotics and constructed a conceptual model of the information. Particular words, syntagms, and punctuation elements were marked in the SPC texts, and automatic extraction was then used to build a knowledge base. This base was used to create dynamic HTML tables displaying the activity spectra of the antibiotics. MEASUREMENTS: The authors analyzed the performances of automatic extraction (recall and precision). RESULTS: The conceptual pharmacodynamics model dealt with antibiotics, pathogens, susceptibility tests, and the prevalence of resistance. Automatic extraction had a recall rate of 97.9% and a precision of 96.2%. The tool displaying antibiotic spectra and resistance prevalences used color codes to identify differences in susceptibility. CONCLUSION: This tool can provide an overview of the prevalence of resistance as expressed in SPC in primary care settings. Its potential impact should be evaluated.",

The goal of the study was to investigate how the properties of these different but informationally equivalent representations supported information retrieval and problem solving using the database. Thirty-six participants performed a number of information retrieval and problem solving tasks, in one of three experimental conditions: 2D graph, 3D graph and 3D helix plot. Measures included performance time and accuracy and user attitudes concerning the usability of the displays. Despite certain navigational problems associated with the 2D representation, the results indicated a performance advantage for the 2D display compared with both 3D representations. Generally, the analyses revealed that the differences in representational characteristics have a significant effect on the level of cognitive effort required to perform the tasks.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Wikipedia is a collaboratively edited encyclopedia. One of the most popular websites on the Internet, it is known to be a frequently used source of health care information by both professionals and the lay public. Objective: This paper quantifies the production and consumption of Wikipedia's medical content along 4 dimensions. First, we measured the amount of medical content in both articles and bytes and, second, the citations that supported that content. Third, we analyzed the medical readership against that of other health care websites between Wikipedia's natural language editions and its relationship with disease prevalence. Fourth, we surveyed the quantity/characteristics of Wikipedia's medical contributors, including year-over-year participation trends and editor demographics. Methods: Using a well-defined categorization infrastructure, we identified medically pertinent English-language Wikipedia articles and links to their foreign language equivalents. With these, Wikipedia can be queried to produce metadata and full texts for entire article histories. Wikipedia also makes available hourly reports that aggregate reader traffic at per-article granularity. An online survey was used to determine the background of contributors. Standard mining and visualization techniques (eg, aggregation queries, cumulative distribution functions, and/or correlation metrics) were applied to each of these datasets. Analysis focused on year-end 2013, but historical data permitted some longitudinal analysis. Results: Wikipedia's medical content (at the end of 2013) was made up of more than 155,000 articles and 1 billion bytes of text across more than 255 languages. This content was supported by more than 950,000 references. Content was viewed more than 4.88 billion times in 2013. This makes it one of if not the most viewed medical resource(s) globally. The core editor community numbered less than 300 and declined over the past 5 years. The members of this community were half health care providers and 85.5% (100/117) had a university education. Conclusions: Although Wikipedia has a considerable volume of multilingual medical content that is extensively read and well-referenced, the core group of editors that contribute and maintain that content is small and shrinking in size.",

Two types of techniques are discussed. Techniques of the first type facilitate the access to the content of patent documentation provided in a textual format \u2013 be it by the human reader or by the machine \u2013 in that they rephrase and summarize the documentation and map it onto a formal semantic representation. Techniques of the second type operate on the content representation. At this stage, PATExpert is explored in two technology areas \u2013 optical recording devices and machine tools.

This information is vital for scientists, institutions, and policy stakeholders to evaluate research areas where more infrastructural or scholarly contributions are required.<bold>Methods: </bold>For analyses, we used CiteSpace (version 4.0 R5; Drexel University), which is a Java-based software that allows scientometric analysis, especially visualization of collaborative networks and research themes in a specific field.<bold>Results: </bold>We found that scholarly activity has experienced a significant increase in the last decade. Most important works were conducted by institutions located in high-income countries. A discipline-specific shift from radiology to telestroke, teledermatology, telepsychiatry, and primary care was observed. The most important innovations that yielded a collaborative influence were reported in the following medical disciplines, in descending order: public environmental and occupational health, psychiatry, pediatrics, health policy and services, nursing, rehabilitation, radiology, pharmacology, surgery, respiratory medicine, neurosciences, obstetrics, and geriatrics.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Despite a continuous rise in scholarly activity in telemedicine, we noticed several gaps in the literature. For instance, all the primary and secondary research central to telemedicine was conducted in the context of high-income countries, including the evidence synthesis approaches that pertained to implementation aspects of telemedicine.

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>The growth in the availability of personal genomic data to nonexperts poses multiple challenges to human-computer interaction research; data are highly sensitive, complex, and have health implications for individuals and families. However, there has been little research on how nonexpert users explore their genomic data.<bold>Objective: </bold>We focus on how to support nonexperts in exploring and comparing their own personal genomic report with those of other people. We designed and evaluated CrossGenomics, a novel tool for comparing personal genetic reports, which enables exploration of shared and unshared genetic variants. Focusing on communicating comparative impact, rarity, and certainty, we evaluated alternative novel interactive prototypes.<bold>Methods: </bold>We conducted 3 user studies. The first focuses on assessing the usability and understandability of a prototype that facilitates the comparison of reports from 2 family members. Following a design iteration, we studied how various prototypes support the comparison of genetic reports of a 4-person family. Finally, we evaluated the needs of early adopters-people who share their genetic reports publicly for comparing their genetic reports with that of others.<bold>Results: </bold>In the first study, sunburst- and Venn-based comparisons of two genomes led to significantly higher domain comprehension, compared with the linear comparison and with the commonly used tabular format. However, results show gaps between objective and subjective comprehension, as sunburst users reported significantly lower perceived understanding and higher levels of confusion than the users of the tabular report. In the second study, users who were allowed to switch between the different comparison views presented higher comprehension levels, as well as more complex reasoning than users who were limited to a single comparison view. In the third study, 35% (17/49) reported learning something new from comparing their own data with another person's data. Users indicated that filtering and toggling between comparison views were the most useful features.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Our findings (1) highlight features and visualizations that show strengths in facilitating user comprehension of genomic data, (2) demonstrate the value of affording users the flexibility to examine the same report using multiple views, and (3) emphasize users' needs in comparison of genomic data. We conclude with design implications for engaging nonexperts with complex multidimensional genomic data.",

        "Abstract": "The automated detection of plagiarism is an information retrieval task of increasing importance as the volume of readily accessible information on the web expands. A major shortcoming of current automated plagiarism detection approaches is their dependence on high character-based similarity. As a result, heavily disguised plagiarism forms, such as paraphrases, translated plagiarism, or structural and idea plagiarism, remain undetected. A recently proposed language-independent approach to plagiarism detection, Citation-based Plagiarism Detection ( CbPD), allows the detection of semantic similarity even in the absence of text overlap by analyzing the citation placement in a document's full text to determine similarity. This article evaluates the performance of CbPD in detecting plagiarism with various degrees of disguise in a collection of 185,000 biomedical articles. We benchmark CbPD against two character-based detection approaches using a ground truth approximated in a user study. Our evaluation shows that the citation-based approach achieves superior ranking performance for heavily disguised plagiarism forms. Additionally, we demonstrate CbPD to be computationally more efficient than character-based approaches. Finally, upon combining the citation-based with the traditional character-based document similarity visualization methods in a hybrid detection prototype, we observe a reduction in the required user effort for document verification.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Twitter is becoming an important tool in medicine, but there is little information on Twitter metrics. In order to recommend best practices for information dissemination and diffusion, it is important to first study and analyze the networks.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study describes the characteristics of four medical networks, analyzes their theoretical dissemination potential, their actual dissemination, and the propagation and distribution of tweets.<bold>Methods: </bold>Open Twitter data was used to characterize four networks: the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American College of Physicians (ACP). Data were collected between July 2012 and September 2012. Visualization was used to understand the follower overlap between the groups. Actual flow of the tweets for each group was assessed. Tweets were examined using Topsy, a Twitter data aggregator.<bold>Results: </bold>The theoretical information dissemination potential for the groups is large. A collective community is emerging, where large percentages of individuals are following more than one of the groups. The overlap across groups is small, indicating a limited amount of community cohesion and cross-fertilization. The AMA followers' network is not as active as the other networks. The AMA posted the largest number of tweets while the AAP posted the fewest. The number of retweets for each organization was low indicating dissemination that is far below its potential.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>To increase the dissemination potential, medical groups should develop a more cohesive community of shared followers. Tweet content must be engaging to provide a hook for retweeting and reaching potential audience. Next steps call for content analysis, assessment of the behavior and actions of the messengers and the recipients, and a larger-scale study that considers other medical groups using Twitter.",

        "Abstract": "Background Maintaining continuity of care (CoC) in the inpatient setting is dependent on aligning goals and tasks with the plan of care (POC) during multidisciplinary rounds (MDRs). A number of locally developed rounding tools exist, yet there is a lack of standard content and functional specifications for electronic tools to support MDRs within and across settings. Objective To identify content and functional requirements for an MDR tool to support CoC. Materials and methods We collected discrete clinical data elements (CDEs) discussed during rounds for 128 acute and critical care patients. To capture CDEs, we developed and validated an iPad-based observational tool based on informatics CoC standards. We observed 19 days of rounds and conducted eight group and individual interviews. Descriptive and bivariate statistics and network visualization were conducted to understand associations between CDEs discussed during rounds with a particular focus on the POC. Qualitative data were thematically analyzed. All analyses were triangulated. Results We identified the need for universal and configurable MDR tool views across settings and users and the provision of messaging capability. Eleven empirically derived universal CDEs were identified, including four POC CDEs: problems, plan, goals, and short-term concerns. Configurable POC CDEs were: rationale, tasks/'to dos', pending results and procedures, discharge planning, patient preferences, need for urgent review, prognosis, and advice/guidance. Discussion Some requirements differed between settings; yet, there was overlap between POC CDEs. Conclusions We recommend an initial list of 11 universal CDEs for continuity in MDRs across settings and 27 CDEs that can be configured to meet settingspecific needs.",

Birger Hj\u00f8rland was the most cited author, and was situated at or near the middle of each of the maps based on different citation relationships. The proximities between authors resulting from the different citation relationships demonstrate ho w authors situate themselves intellectually through the citations they give and how other authors situate them through the citations received. There is a consistent core of theoretical references as well among the most productive authors. We observed a close network of scholarly communication between the authors cited in this core, which indicates the actual role of the journal Knowledge Organization as a space for knowledge construction in the area of knowledge organization.",

CRIS has a primary mission to promote cutting-edge, world-class, trans-departmental research within HU, and it conducts fundamental, commercialization-related, cross-disciplinary research and nurtures young in-house/recruited researchers through targeted, innovative tenure-track programs in multiple disciplines. Its research output derives from 3- to 7-year-long time-bound projects funded strategically by HU, external grants [e.g., MEXT Super-COE HU Research and Business Park Project (FY2003-7)], industry-university collaboration with regional businesses, and endowments (e.g., Meiji Dairies). Analyses using co-words, bibliographic coupling, overlay map aided with visualization, etc., lead to the following inferences: (i) The published items comprise a dozen well-defined (inter-)disciplinary clusters, dominated by 3 macro-disciplines (biomedical science, 33%; chemistry, 21%; agricultural science, ca. 10%) that constitute 18 clusters used for mapping; (ii) research conducted by externally funded or endowed projects in the biomedical, physical and environmental science and technology fields (3 broad areas of aggregation derived from the Science Overlay Map) is interdisciplinary; and (iii) there is an apparently low visibility of publications from projects jointly executed with industries to an almost complete absence of output from CRIS in the fields of social sciences in the WoS database.",

A scientometric analysis was applied to evaluate the performance status and research front using knowledge domain visualization techniques in this work. The data consists of 17,413 tourism-themed literatures retrieved from Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index databases since 1900. What were analyzed included the publication outputs, document types, productive publications, languages used frequently as well as fruitful countries/territories and institutions contributing to English articles and the co-citation network of references in the past decade. The cumulated literature records of tourism-related research have increased exponentially over past 40 years, revealing that tourism research is in its rapid development stage. It turned out that there were fourteen types of documents and academic articles accounted for the largest proportion. Literatures were published in a wide range of 2082 publications, of which Annals of Tourism Research and Tourism Management were in the vanguard of the most productive journals for tourism research. English is the most popular language in publication. USA, UK and Australia were the most productive countries; New Zealand, Peoples R China, UK and Australia were the most close cooperation groups, and Austria; New Zealand, Japan and Peoples R China had the most innovation. The most productive institutes included Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Griffith University, University of Queensland, University of Surrey and Texas A&M University. The co-citation cluster analysis reveals the distribution of popular topics and the representative literatures during the past decade. Online tourism, consumer perceptions and behavioral intentions, tourism demand forecasting, as well as tourism destination competitiveness are the research frontiers of Tourism Discipline.",

A new method based on MeSH terms was proposed to identify emerging topics and trends of medical informatics research. Informetric methods and visualization technologies were applied to investigate research trends of medical informatics. The metric of perspective factor (PF) embedding MeSH terms was appropriately employed to assess the perspective quality for journals. The emerging MeSH terms have changed dramatically over the last 12 years, identifying two stages of medical informatics: the 'medical imaging stage' and the 'medical informatics stage'. The focus of medical informatics has shifted from acquisition and storage of healthcare data by integrating computational, informational, cognitive and organizational sciences to semantic analysis for problem solving and clinical decision-making. About 30 core journals were determined by Bradford's Law in the last 3 years in this area. These journals, with high PF values, have relative high perspective quality and lead the trend of medical informatics.",

Through a comparative case study, the paper investigates the potential of using a virtual 3D model of the 1938 British Empire Exhibition in formal educational settings and highlights a number of salient issues and challenges. As the data suggests, engagement with the model created opportunities for playful learning, facilitated motivation and collaboration, and enhanced student interest. However, participation was often compromised by technical inhibitors as well as the wider pressures of the curriculum, teacher time and assessment regimes. Last, the paper considers the range of actors and factors that influenced the experiences of teachers and students who engaged with the use of the 3D model and concludes by considering the implications of these findings.",

The fluidity and fuzziness of the interdisciplinary delineations in the different visualizations can be reduced and clarified using factor analysis. We also explore newly available routines (' CorText') to analyze this development in terms of 'tubes' using an alluvial map and compare the results with an animation (using 'Visone'). The historical specificity of this development can be compared with the development of 'artificial intelligence' into an integrated specialty during this same period. Interdisciplinarity should be defined differently at the level of journals and of specialties.",

Intuitive visual representations of the status of a system and the flow of information within and between legal and system models mean developers can embody the aims of the legislation from the very beginning of the software design process, while lawyers can gain an understanding of the inner workings of the software without needing to understand code. The approach can also facilitate automated formal verification of the models\u2019 interactions, paving the way for machine-assisted privacy by design and, potentially, more general \u2018compliance by design\u2019.

        "Abstract": "Using 3 years of the Journal Citation Reports (2011, 2012, and 2013), indicators of transitions in 2012 (between 2011 and 2013) were studied using methodologies based on entropy statistics. Changes can be indicated at the level of journals using the margin totals of entropy production along the row or column vectors, but also at the level of links among journals by importing the transition matrices into network analysis and visualization programs (and using community-finding algorithms). Seventy-four journals were flagged in terms of discontinuous changes in their citations, but 3,114 journals were involved in 'hot' links. Most of these links are embedded in a main component; 78 clusters (containing 172 journals) were flagged as potential 'hot spots' emerging at the network level. An additional finding was that PLoS ONE introduced a new communication dynamic into the database. The limitations of the methodology were elaborated using an example. The results of the study indicate where developments in the citation dynamics can be considered as significantly unexpected. This can be used as heuristic information, but what a 'hot spot' in terms of the entropy statistics of aggregated citation relations means substantively can be expected to vary from case to case.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Background: Citation counts for peer-reviewed articles and the impact factor of journals have long been indicators of article importance or quality. In the Web 2.0 era, growing numbers of scholars are using scholarly social network tools to communicate scientific ideas with colleagues, thereby making traditional indicators less sufficient, immediate, and comprehensive. In these new situations, the altmetric indicators offer alternative measures that reflect the multidimensional nature of scholarly impact in an immediate, open, and individualized way. In this direction of research, some studies have demonstrated the correlation between altmetrics and traditional metrics with different samples. However, up to now, there has been relatively little research done on the dimension and interaction structure of altmetrics. Objective: Our goal was to reveal the number of dimensions that altmetric indicators should be divided into and the structure in which altmetric indicators interact with each other. Methods: Because an article-level metrics dataset is collected from scholarly social media and open access platforms, it is one of the most robust samples available to study altmetric indicators. Therefore, we downloaded a large dataset containing activity data in 20 types of metrics present in 33,128 academic articles from the application programming interface website. First, we analyzed the correlation among altmetric indicators using Spearman rank correlation. Second, we visualized the multiple correlation coefficient matrixes with graduated colors. Third, inputting the correlation matrix, we drew an MDS diagram to demonstrate the dimension for altmetric indicators. For correlation structure, we used a social network map to represent the social relationships and the strength of relations. Results: We found that the distribution of altmetric indicators is significantly non-normal and positively skewed. The distribution of downloads and page views follows the Pareto law. Moreover, we found that the Spearman coefficients from 91.58% of the pairs of variables indicate statistical significance at the .01 level. The non-metric MDS map divided the 20 altmetric indicators into three clusters: traditional metrics, active altmetrics, and inactive altmetrics. The social network diagram showed two subgroups that are tied to each other but not to other groups, thus indicating an intersection between altmetrics and traditional metric indicators. Conclusions: Altmetrics complement, and most correlate significantly with, traditional measures. Therefore, in future evaluations of the social impact of articles, we should consider not only traditional metrics but also active altmetrics. There may also be a transfer phenomenon for the social impact of academic articles. The impact transfer path has transfer, or intermediate, stations that transport and accelerate article social impact from active altmetrics to traditional metrics and vice versa. This discovery will be helpful to explain the impact transfer mechanism of articles in the Web 2.0 era. Hence, altmetrics are in fact superior to traditional filters for assessing scholarly impact in multiple dimensions and in terms of social structure.",

        "Abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is severely affecting people worldwide. Currently, an important approach to understand this phenomenon and its impact on the lives of people consists of monitoring social networks and news on the internet. Objective: The purpose of this study is to present a methodology to capture the main subjects and themes under discussion in news media and social media and to apply this methodology to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Methods: This work proposes a methodology based on topic modeling, namely entity recognition, and sentiment analysis of texts to compare Twitter posts and news, followed by visualization of the evolution and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We focused our analysis on Brazil, an important epicenter of the pandemic; therefore, we faced the challenge of addressing Brazilian Portuguese texts. Results: In this work, we collected and analyzed 18,413 articles from news media and 1,597,934 tweets posted by 1,299,084 users in Brazil. The results show that the proposed methodology improved the topic sentiment analysis over time, enabling better monitoring of internet media. Additionally, with this tool, we extracted some interesting insights about the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. For instance, we found that Twitter presented similar topic coverage to news media; the main entities were similar, but they differed in theme distribution and entity diversity. Moreover, some aspects represented negative sentiment toward political themes in both media, and a high incidence of mentions of a specific drug denoted high political polarization during the pandemic. Conclusions: This study identified the main themes under discussion in both news and social media and how their sentiments evolved over time. It is possible to understand the major concerns of the public during the pandemic, and all the obtained information is thus useful for decision-making by authorities.

        "Abstract": "Databases are nowadays one more building block in complex multi-tier architectures. In general, however, they are still designed and optimized with little regard for the applications that will run on top of them. This problem is particularly acute in scientific applications where the data is never used or viewed as it is but always processed either for visualization or analysis purposes. In such scenarios, the data is usually processed at the client and, hence, conventional server side optimizations are of limited help. In this paper we present a variety of techniques and a novel client/server architecture designed to optimize the client side processing of scientific data. The main building block in our approach is to store frequently accessed data as relatively small, wavelet-encoded segments. These segments can be processed at different resolutions, thereby enabling efficient processing of very large data volumes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces overhead (I/O, transfer across network, decoding and analysis). Furthermore, it does not require changes to the analysis routines and provides all possible resolution ranges. In the paper we describe these ideas and how they have been implemented in HEDC (RHESSI Experimental Data Center), a multi-TByte data hub for RHESSI, the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager satellite of NASA.",

While the online platform allows researchers to recruit and enroll more participants, there is an increased risk of participant dropout in Web-based research. Often, these dropout trends are simply reported, adjusted for, or ignored altogether. Objective: To propose a conceptual framework that analyzes respondent attrition and demonstrates the utility of these methods with existing survey data. Methods: First, we suggest visualization of attrition trends using bar charts and survival curves. Next, we propose a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to detect or confirm significant attrition points. Finally, we suggest applications of existing statistical methods to investigate the effect of internal survey characteristics and patient characteristics on dropout. In order to apply this framework, we conducted a case study; a seventeen-item Informed Decision-Making (IDM) module addressing how and why patients make decisions about cancer screening. Results: Using the framework, we were able to find significant attrition points at Questions 4, 6, 7, and 9, and were also able to identify participant responses and characteristics associated with dropout at these points and overall. Conclusions: When these methods were applied to survey data, significant attrition trends were revealed, both visually and empirically, that can inspire researchers to investigate the factors associated with survey dropout, address whether survey completion is associated with health outcomes, and compare attrition patterns between groups. The framework can be used to extract information beyond simple responses, can be useful during survey development, and can help determine the external validity of survey results.",

        "Abstract": "Early literature on e-democracy was dominated by euphoric claims about the benefits of e-voting (digital direct democracy) or continuous online citizen consultations (digital representative democracy). High expectations have gradually been replaced with more genuine approaches that aim to break with the dichotomy of traditional notions of direct and representative democracy. The ensuing question relates to the adequate design of information and communication technology (ICT) applications to foster such visions. This article contributes to this search and discusses issues concerning the adequate institutional framework. Recently, so-called Web 2.0 applications, such as social networking and Wikipedia, have proven that it is possible for millions of users to collectively create meaningful content online. While these recent developments are not necessarily labeled e-democracy in the literature, this article argues that they and related applications have the potential to fulfill the promise of breaking with the longstanding democratic trade-off between group size (direct mass voting on predefined issues) and depth of argument (deliberation and discourse in a small group). Complementary information-structuring techniques are at hand to facilitate large-scale deliberations and the negotiation of interests between members of a group. This article presents three of these techniques in more depth: weighted preference voting, argument visualization, and the Semantic Web initiative. Notwithstanding these developments, the maturing concept of e-democracy still faces serious challenges. Questions remain in political and computer science disciplines that ask about adequate institutional frameworks, the omnipresent democratic challenges of equal access and free participation, and the appropriate technological design.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: There has been a tremendous growth in the amount of information and resources on the World Wide Web that are useful to researchers and practitioners in science domains. While the Web has made the communication and sharing of research ideas and results among scientists easier and faster than ever, its dynamic and unstructured nature also makes the scientists faced with such problems as information overload, vocabulary difference, and lack of analysis tools. To address these problems, it is highly desirable to have an integrated, \u201cone-stop shopping\u201d Web portal to support effective information searching and analysis as well as to enhance communication and collaboration among researchers in various scientific fields. In this paper, we review existing information retrieval techniques and related literature, and propose a framework for developing integrated Web portals that support information searching and analysis for scientific knowledge. Our framework incorporates collection building, meta-searching, keyword suggestion, and various content analysis techniques such as document summarization, document clustering, and topic map visualization. Patent analysis techniques such as citation analysis and content map analysis are also incorporated. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we developed based on our architecture a knowledge portal, called NanoPort, in the field of nanoscale science and engineering. We report our experience and explore the various issues of relevance to developing a Web portal for scientific domains. The system was compared to other search systems in the field and several design issues were identified. An evaluation study was conducted and the results showed that subjects were more satisfied with the NanoPort system than with Scirus, a leading search engine for scientific articles. Through our prototype system, we demonstrated the feasibility of using such an integrated approach and the study brought insight into applying the proposed domain-independent architecture to different areas of science and engineering in the future.",

        "Abstract": "We present a generic and flexible framework for building geoscientific metadata portals independent of content standards for metadata and protocols. Data can be harvested with commonly used protocols (e.g., Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting) and metadata standards like DIF or ISO 19115. The new Java-based portal software supports any XML encoding and makes metadata searchable through Apache Lucene. Software administrators are free to define searchable fields independent of their type using XPath. In addition, by extending the full-text search engine (FTS) Apache Lucene, we have significantly improved queries for numerical and date/time ranges by supplying a new trie-based algorithm, thus, enabling high-performance space/time retrievals in FTS-based geo portals. The harvested metadata are stored in separate indexes, which makes it possible to combine these into different portals. The portal-specific Java API and web service interface is highly flexible and supports custom front-ends for users, provides automatic query completion (AJAX), and dynamic visualization with conventional mapping tools. The software has been made freely available through the open source concept.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose \u2013 In this paper the aim is to present Debate Dashboard, an online collaborative platform designed to support distributed knowledge management and decision making. The platform integrates an argument mapping tool with visual widgets with the objective of enhancing collective sense-making and mutual understanding as well as to compensate for the costs of mediated communication in virtual collaborative environments.Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The design of Debate Dashboard is based on the theory of common ground according to which participants involved in a conversation build mutual understanding thanks to the exchange of different types of feedback. Using the concept of grounding cost, the authors identified several features of the Dashboard supposed to favour mutual understanding and knowledge sharing. Such features have been implemented through six visual widgets selected through a benchmarking of currently available visualization tools.Findings \u2013 The paper discusses the limitations and advantages of online argumentation to support online discussions and presents a review of current visualization tools. The design of a new platform able to integrate online argumentation and visualization technologies is described and it is argued that Debate Dashboard will improve online collaboration in many respects especially in terms of supporting the construction of shared knowledge representations for geographically distributed collaborative teams.Originality/value \u2013 First, the work adds to the debate on the development of online argumentation platforms by offering an alternative theoretical perspective based on language and conversational studies. Second, it proposes for the first time to integrate argumentation and visualization technologies in the same tool to create an augmented collaborative platform able to overcome the limitations of both traditional online collaboration technologies, such as forums and wikis, as well as the criticalities associated with the use of argumentation technologies.",

        "Abstract": "Many large digital collections are currently organized by subject; although useful, these information organization structures are large and complex and thus difficult to browse. Current online tools and visualization prototypes show small, localized subsets and do not provide the ability to explore the predominant patterns of the overall subject structure. This study describes subject tree modifications that facilitate browsing for documents by capitalizing on the highly uneven distribution of real-world collections. The approach is demonstrated on two large collections organized by the Library of Congress Subject Headings ( LCSH) and Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH). Results show that the LCSH subject tree can be reduced to 49% of its initial complexity while maintaining access to 83% of the collection, and the MeSH tree can be reduced to 45% of its initial complexity while maintaining access to 97% of the collection. A simple solution to negate the loss of access is discussed. The visual impact is demonstrated by using traditional outline views and a slider control allowing searchers to change the subject structure dynamically according to their needs. This study has implications for the development of information organization theory and human-information interaction techniques for subject trees.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge organization systems need tags to centralize and provide the keywords that can be employed in classifying, sharing and seeking knowledge for personal or organizational use. However, the increased variety of vocabularies and languages causes the connections between textual tags and the documents marked by them to become less and less distinctive. The purpose of this paper is to present an exploratory study on new type of knowledge tags: structured iconic tags. This kind of tag is created based on the special graphical rule \u2013 Visual Distinctive Language (VDL) \u2013 and has particular focus on the representation of tag structure. A \u2018tagging on paper\u2019 experiment was conducted to compare tagging results among three types of tags: textual tags, iconic tags without explicit structure and VDL-based iconic tags. Experimental results demonstrated that the new type of iconic tags improves the representation of tag structure as well as the interpretation of tag meaning. This work is one of the first to investigate how icons would be applied for tagging and what kind of graphical code would better represent knowledge organization. Findings in this paper could enrich the tagging method, which in turn provides a possible way to develop a visual knowledge organization system and iconic tag clouds for digital library.",

        "Abstract": "With the help of social web, social users can create, manage, share or react without undergoing the formal mechanisms of quality control. The way social users respond to scholarly outputs on the social web is called social citation, which can show the broadening of impact from academia to society. Climate change is one of the most life-threatening issues that everybody should be sensible and react to. Studying the scientific and social citations of articles dealing with climate changes, the present study attempts to provide new insights into the amount of social users' attention and reactions. It also investigates the correlation between scientific and social citations to shed light on the potential of altmetrics as an alternative or supplementary to its traditional predecessor. Besides, the study aims to carry out co-word analysis of scientific texts in the field and identify hot topics. Our findings showed that 3141 out of 6100 climate changes related articles retrieved from WoS were present in Altmetric explorer. They received 84380 and 17361 social and traditional citations, respectively. The articles were revealed to be mostly represented in Mendeley (133002 reads) and Tweeter (72108 tweets) followed by News outlet, Facebook, and blogs. The results of Spearman correlation test revealed a significant, though weak, correlation between WoS citations and social citations including Tweets, Mendeley readers, Facebook posts, blog posts, Google+ posts, news outlet and Article Attention Score. Multidisciplinary sciences were the most productive subject areas with the highest number of scientific and social citations. Co-word analysis of the articles showed that greenhouse gases emission; warming; species; adaptation; precipitation; energy; country, soil and crops are among the most frequent words. The value of the present study lies in the clarification of the extent to which social network users pay attention to climatic issues and how much is the power of altmetrics in showing the impact of science on society. Visualization of climate changes articles helps redirect cultural-political debates and associates discourses. It can help raise awareness in people and engage them in environmental conservation.",

In this study, we analyzed eleven years of Web of Knowledge-indexed peer-reviewed articles from researchers at the twenty-eight United States American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) accredited veterinary colleges. We had three goals in assessing the published literature of veterinary college researchers. First, we identified a list of journals and research areas outside veterinary medicine in which veterinary researchers publish. This list of journals can be customized to identify those most essential at each institution. Second, we identified collaborative work by veterinary researchers across disciplines and institutions. Using textual analysis tools and visualizations helped us illustrate and clarify these data. Last, we developed a methodology for defining an interdisciplinary serials list outside a subject core that can be customized for specific institutions and subject areas.",

However, visualizing subtle examination is limited because only author co-citation information is required in ACA. The proposed method, called modified author co-citation analysis (MACA), exploits author co-citation relationship, citations published time, citations published carriers, and citations keywords, to construct MACA-based co-citation matrices. According to the results of our experiments: (1) MACA shows a good clustering result with more delicacy and more clearness; (2) more information involved in co-citation analysis performs good visual acuity; (3) in visualization of co-citation network produced by MACA, the points in different categories have far more distance, and the points indicating authors in the same category are closer together. As a result, the proposed MACA is found that more detailed and subtle information of a knowledge domain analyzed can be obtained, compared to ACA.",

They also need to acknowledge the potential value of research activity and the challenges of ongoing improvement and development. Conference programmes may prove a useful source of stimulation, especially if supplemented by creativity techniques, action research and the ideal of 'finding flow'. Objectives:  The article analyses the themes and papers presented at the 10th International Conference on International Medical Librarianship (ICML) to identify opportunities for further research, literature reviews, assessment of practices and services, etc. Methods:  Content analysis approach to conference papers and suggestions for further action including supplementing with techniques of creativity and group input. Results:  A fairly extensive list of further actions (although not intended to be exhaustive) is suggested for the sixteen conference themes. Although subjective, the list might help to stimulate growth in research on health librarianship and demonstrate how one source of stimulation - conference programmes (regularly presented to medical library communities) - can be used. Conclusions:  Content analysis has proven a constructive means of generating research questions from a conference programme. Content analysis and other methods aimed at stimulating creative and progressive thinking, including brainstorming, force field analysis, De Bono's 6 hats, creative swiping and creative visualisation, may prove equally useful and require further investigation. To ensure an ongoing cycle, these can be linked to action research.",

        "Abstract": "We are investigating the potential of 3D telepresence, or televideo, technology to support collaboration among geographically separated medical personnel in trauma emergency care situations. 3D telepresence technology has the potential to provide richer visual information than current 2D videoconferencing techniques. This may be of benefit in diagnosing and treating patients in emergency situations where specialized medical expertise is not locally available. The 3D telepresence technology does not yet exist, and there is a need to understand its potential before resources are spent on its development and deployment. This poses a complex challenge. How can we evaluate the potential impact of a technology within complex, dynamic work contexts when the technology does not yet exist? To address this challenge, we conducted an experiment with a posttest, between-subjects design that takes the medical situation and context into account. In the experiment, we simulated an emergency medical situation involving practicing paramedics and physicians, collaborating remotely via two conditions: with today's 2D videoconferencing and a 3D telepresence proxy. In this article, we examine information sharing between the attending paramedic and collaborating physician. Postquestionnaire data illustrate that the information provided by the physician was perceived to be more useful by the paramedic in the 3D proxy condition than in the 2D condition; however, data pertaining to the quality of interaction and trust between the collaborating physician and paramedic show mixed results. Postinterview data help explain these results.",

        "Abstract": "Background:  Citation analysis has become an important tool for research performance assessment in the medical sciences. However, different areas of medical research may have considerably different citation practices, even within the same medical field. Because of this, it is unclear to what extent citation-based bibliometric indicators allow for valid comparisons between research units active in different areas of medical research.      Methodology:  A visualization methodology is introduced that reveals differences in citation practices between medical research areas. The methodology extracts terms from the titles and abstracts of a large collection of publications and uses these terms to visualize the structure of a medical field and to indicate how research areas within this field differ from each other in their average citation impact.      Results:  Visualizations are provided for 32 medical fields, defined based on journal subject categories in the Web of Science database. The analysis focuses on three fields: Cardiac & cardiovascular systems, Clinical neurology, and Surgery. In each of these fields, there turn out to be large differences in citation practices between research areas. Low-impact research areas tend to focus on clinical intervention research, while high-impact research areas are often more oriented on basic and diagnostic research.      Conclusions:  Popular bibliometric indicators, such as the h-index and the impact factor, do not correct for differences in citation practices between medical fields. These indicators therefore cannot be used to make accurate between-field comparisons. More sophisticated bibliometric indicators do correct for field differences but still fail to take into account within-field heterogeneity in citation practices. As a consequence, the citation impact of clinical intervention research may be substantially underestimated in comparison with basic and diagnostic research.",

        "Abstract": "This article describes the latest development of a generic approach to detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature. The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature\u2014an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in CiteSpace II, a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981\u20132004) and terrorism (1990\u20132003). Prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks were verified in collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work are discussed. A number of challenges and opportunities for future studies are identified.",

        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Graphical representation of a patient's anatomy is fairly similar in the majority of orthopaedic surgery planning programs. The position of implantable devices is usually established using a three-pane window showing 2D cross sections of the CT data set taken on three user-selectable orthogonal planes. In some cases this orthogonal-plane representation is replaced or extended by interactive 3D visualization, obtained using surface rendering techniques. These ways to represent the CT data come naturally and easily to the programmer. However, the efficacy of these display strategies is questionable. The present study aims to assess if the display modality used to visualize CT data affects the inherent spatial accuracy achievable in a surgical planning application. A group of users was asked to perform repeatedly a specific planning task using various display interfaces to the same underlying software application. The planning task was designed to allow an assessment of the accuracy with which each user was able to position the prosthetic component. A specialized interface, called multimodal display, presented a peak error of 0.45 mm and 0.95 deg, significantly lower than the 2.4 mm and 4 deg for the othogonal slices interface, and the 3.8 mm and 16.7 deg for the 3D-rendering interface. The results of this study indicate an important effect of the type of visualization modality used to represent CT data on final accuracy of the planning operation.",

        "Abstract": "Petroleum-bearing sedimentary basin is an emerging digital ecosystem. Petroleum system and its elements are narrated for each and every oil and gas field in each and every petroleum-bearing sedimentary basin. A new concept of ecosystem and its digitization are emerging within the generic petroleum system. The Significance of this concept comes with an ability to establish connectivity among petroleum subsystems, for example, Albertine Graben (Western Uganda), through attributes of their components and their contextualization and specifications. Unless the phenomenon of integration of elements and processes among subbasins in the context of digital representation, visualization, and interpretation are understood, the existence of petroleum system (both at local and global scales) and its survival, the phenomenon of 'interconnectivity' among ecosystems cannot be well explained. Its value cannot be added in terms of petroleum accumulations and volumes, unless these phenomena are made explicit. Authors propose ontology-based data warehousing and data mining technologies in which conceptualization and contextualization of multiple data dimensions' are modeled (elements and processes of petroleum system), besides their integration (within data warehouse environment) and data mining of interpretable emerging petroleum digital ecosystem. Multidimensional data warehousing and mining facilitate an effective interpretation of petroleum ecosystems, minimizing the ambiguities involved during structure and reservoir qualifications and quantifications, especially during reserve computations. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "Abstract": "The use of quantitative metrics to gauge the impact of scholarly publications, authors, and disciplines is predicated on the availability of reliable usage and annotation data. Citation and download counts are widely available from digital libraries. However, current annotation systems rely on proprietary labels, refer to journals but not articles or authors, and are manually curated. To address these limitations, we propose a social framework based on crowdsourced annotations of scholars, designed to keep up with the rapidly evolving disciplinary and interdisciplinary landscape. We describe a system called Scholarometer, which provides a service to scholars by computing citation-based impact measures. This creates an incentive for users to provide disciplinary annotations of authors, which in turn can be used to compute disciplinary metrics. We first present the system architecture and several heuristics to deal with noisy bibliographic and annotation data. We report on data sharing and interactive visualization services enabled by Scholarometer. Usage statistics, illustrating the data collected and shared through the framework, suggest that the proposed crowdsourcing approach can be successful. Secondly, we illustrate how the disciplinary bibliometric indicators elicited by Scholarometer allow us to implement for the first time a universal impact measure proposed in the literature. Our evaluation suggests that this metric provides an effective means for comparing scholarly impact across disciplinary boundaries.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a proposed information environment (PROPIE) for enhanced interaction and value-adding of electronic documents (e-documents). The design of PROPIE was based on a thorough user needs and requirements assessment in interacting with information through well-documented findings, and a focus group with twelve participants to elicit features that were deemed desirable in future interactions. The design was also based on an earlier work which reviewed the advancements in various user interface (UI) technologies, visualisation and interactive techniques, and a consideration of novel information structuring and organisation techniques that pose important implications for the design of more advanced UIs. Providing a suite of novel features and interactive tools that can be flexibly combined, PROPIE allows users to apply multiple novel ways to query intuitively and navigate information in an e-document. The querying and browsing processes in PROPIE are supported by various interactive and visualisation techniques. Users work within a visually sovereign, integrated environment for information gathering and organising, based on navigable, fractional information objects that are also affiliated with rich metadata and additional layers of value-adding information. A set of interface mock-ups was developed to demonstrate the potential of the environment in supporting the design of a new generation of electronic journals (e-journals). We report here empirical results from a study conducted to obtain representative users` feedback with regard to using PROPIE for interacting with e-journals. Twenty-two participants from a variety of academic backgrounds participated in the evaluation. Overall, PROPIE was found to have the potential both for enhancing the user's interaction with information captured within e-journals and for adding value to e-documents in various ways.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Objective Several studies have shown how sets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can help to classify subjects on the basis of their continental origins, with applications to caseecontrol studies and population genetics. However, most of these studies use dimensionality-reduction methods, such as principal component analysis, or clustering methods that result in unipartite (either subjects or SNPs) representations of the data. Such analyses conceal important bipartite relationships, such as how subject and SNP clusters relate to each other, and the genotypes that determine their cluster memberships. Methods To overcome the limitations of current methods of analyzing SNP data, the authors used three bipartite analytical representations (bipartite network, heat map with dendrograms, and Circos ideogram) that enable the simultaneous visualization and analysis of subjects, SNPs, and subject attributes. Results The results demonstrate (1) novel insights into SNP data that are difficult to derive from purely unipartite views of the data, (2) the strengths and limitations of each method, revealing the role that each play in revealing novel insights, and (3) implications for how the methods can be used for the analysis of SNPs in genomic studies associated with disease. Conclusion The results suggest that bipartite representations can reveal new patterns in SNP data compared with existing unipartite representations. However, the novel insights require multiple representations to discover, verify, and comprehend the complex relationships. The results therefore motivate the need for a complementary visual analytical framework that guides the use of multiple bipartite representations to analyze complex relationships in SNP data.",

Using analysis based on Peirce's ten semiotic triads and Eco's connotative semiotics, a scientific work can be identified as a trivalent compound connotative semiotic.

Any and all of these approaches may relate to any or all of the three classes of knowledge content outlined above as being characteristic of a scientific work. Numerical analysis by neural networks of any of these characteristics of a document could lead to production of a \u0093fingerprint\u0094 identifying the document and specifying its knowledge content.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Social network analysis provides a perspective and method for inquiring into the structures that comprise online groups and communities. Traces from interaction via social media provide the opportunity for understanding how a community is formed and maintained online. Objective: The paper aims to demonstrate how social network analysis provides a vocabulary and set of techniques for examining interaction patterns via social media. Using the case of the #hcsmca online discussion forum, this paper highlights what has been and can be gained by approaching online community from a social network perspective, as well as providing an inside look at the structure of the #hcsmca community. Methods: Social network analysis was used to examine structures in a 1-month sample of Twitter messages with the hashtag #hcsmca (3871 tweets, 486 unique posters), which is the tag associated with the social media\u2013supported group Health Care Social Media Canada. Network connections were considered present if the individual was mentioned, replied to, or had a post retweeted. Results: Network analyses revealed patterns of interaction that characterized the community as comprising one component, with a set of core participants prominent in the network due to their connections with others. Analysis showed the social media health content providers were the most influential group based on in-degree centrality. However, there was no preferential attachment among people in the same professional group, indicating that the formation of connections among community members was not constrained by professional status. Conclusions: Network analysis and visualizations provide techniques and a vocabulary for understanding online interaction, as well as insights that can help in understanding what, and who, comprises and sustains a network, and whether community emerges from a network of online interactions.

        "Abstract": "Purpose \u2013 Actor-network theory (ANT) is considered to be both a theoretical position and a methodology. ANT has been the centre of vigorous debates regarding its ontological viewpoint but has also been found to have some drawbacks as a methodology. The purpose of this paper is to use a graphical syntax for ANT to describe the development and implementation of a health information system (IS) in order to assess whether the graphical syntax improves the use of ANT as a methodology. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 An extensive example derived from a case study, describing the development and implementation of an electronic patients\u2019 records system, is illustrated using this graphical syntax. This serves to makes the actors, translations and black boxes in the case visible. Findings \u2013 The syntax is found to help the researcher to conceptualise the research, to highlight assumptions as black boxes and to follow the actor but above all it encourages the researcher to understand the translations being made between actors and to make them explicit. Hence the syntax is found to assist at the analytical phases of a research project. The graphic syntax found to address the criticisms identified for ANT as an IS research methodology. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The proposed graphical syntax assists researchers who use ANT as a methodology. Use of the syntax in education is also foreseen to be practical. The evaluation of ANT-gs in the paper provides an argument for its use but a more reliable argument would be made by collating and analysing feedback from independent modellers who actually use the graphical syntax. This is an important part of future research. Practical implications \u2013 The visualisation of the actor-network provided by ANT-gs provides a relatively simple representation while at the same time it makes key ANT concepts explicit. This is expected to address the issue of superficial understanding of ANT and selective use of its constructs; it makes the actor-network boundaries immediately visible. Thus the paper proposes that ANT-gs will be useful both by IS researchers and as an educational tool but future research is required to verify both these practical implications. The development of a computer-based modelling tool based on this syntax is proposed to facilitate effective and efficient modelling. Originality/value \u2013 This paper proposes a unique tool to support ANT as a methodology. Its use encourages the researcher to focus on constructs that are essential elements of ANT and, by making each of the translation instances explicit, it strengthens the analysis in a way that is true to the view of ANT as a sociology of translation.",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The paper describes current practices and ongoing research, and it discusses potential applications for future use. Findings \u2013 Content-based MIR approaches can extend and enhance the capabilities of traditional text-based discovery and delivery systems and thus support the work of expert users such as musicians and musicologists. Examples of technologies developed in the context of the project include novel methods for automatic chord identification, motif finding, the visualization of musical structure, and retrieval of musical variations using harmonic and structural information. Practical implications \u2013 The paper looks at new, non-verbal modes of interaction with digital music archives based on musically substantive features such as chords, motifs, rhythms, etc. By building more sophisticated dimensions of interactivity into a discovery-and-delivery system, these tools could give the end-user a more meaningful and rewarding experience. The tools potentially would be less costly and more scalable than textual annotation and markup, and their applicability extends beyond digital libraries to other music services. Originality/value \u2013 This article discusses the advantages and challenges posed by audio-based MIR and shows, via project-specific examples, its relevance to supporting the needs of digital music library users.",

The main objectives were to identify the nodes (organizations) and sectors that influence the behaviour of the cardiovascular device development network; to identify the types of collaboration that exist within the network; to quantify the extent of collaboration within the network; and finally to analyse the changes in overall collaboration over time. Collaboration across four sectors was considered: healthcare services, industry, universities, and lastly, science councils and facilities. Author affiliations, extracted from journal articles, were used to generate collaboration networks. Network metrics-degree centrality, betweenness centrality and graph densities-and network graphs were produced using network visualization software (UCINET) in order to identify the influential nodes and sectors, as well as to measure the extent of collaboration within and between sectors. The university and healthcare services sectors were found to make the largest contribution to the development of cardiovascular medical devices in South Africa. Collaboration between universities and healthcare service nodes was the most prevalent type of cross-sector collaboration. Universities were found to be potential key players in the transmission of information across the network, with greater potential than the remaining sectors to form new collaborations with isolated nodes, thereby enhancing device development activity. Foreign nodes played a role in connecting local nodes which would otherwise have been isolated. Overall, collaboration across sectors has increased over the 15 year period, but science councils and industry still have room to become more involved by partnering with the dominant sectors.",

        "Abstract": "Background: A dramatic rise in health-tracking apps for mobile phones has occurred recently. Rich user interfaces make manual logging of users' behaviors easier and more pleasant, and sensors make tracking effortless. To date, however, feedback technologies have been limited to providing overall statistics, attractive visualization of tracked data, or simple tailoring based on age, gender, and overall calorie or activity information. There are a lack of systems that can perform automated translation of behavioral data into specific actionable suggestions that promote healthier lifestyle without any human involvement. Objective: MyBehavior, a mobile phone app, was designed to process tracked physical activity and eating behavior data in order to provide personalized, actionable, low-effort suggestions that are contextualized to the user's environment and previous behavior. This study investigated the technical feasibility of implementing an automated feedback system, the impact of the suggestions on user physical activity and eating behavior, and user perceptions of the automatically generated suggestions. Methods: MyBehavior was designed to (1) use a combination of automatic and manual logging to track physical activity (eg, walking, running, gym), user location, and food, (2) automatically analyze activity and food logs to identify frequent and nonfrequent behaviors, and (3) use a standard machine-learning, decision-making algorithm, called multi-armed bandit (MAB), to generate personalized suggestions that ask users to either continue, avoid, or make small changes to existing behaviors to help users reach behavioral goals. We enrolled 17 participants, all motivated to self-monitor and improve their fitness, in a pilot study of MyBehavior. In a randomized two-group trial, investigators randomly assigned participants to receive either MyBehavior's personalized suggestions (n=9) or nonpersonalized suggestions (n=8), created by professionals, from a mobile phone app over 3 weeks. Daily activity level and dietary intake was monitored from logged data. At the end of the study, an in-person survey was conducted that asked users to subjectively rate their intention to follow MyBehavior suggestions. Results: In qualitative daily diary, interview, and survey data, users reported MyBehavior suggestions to be highly actionable and stated that they intended to follow the suggestions. MyBehavior users walked significantly more than the control group over the 3 weeks of the study (P=.05). Although some MyBehavior users chose lower-calorie foods, the between-group difference was not significant (P=.15). In a poststudy survey, users rated MyBehavior's personalized suggestions more positively than the nonpersonalized, generic suggestions created by professionals (P<.001). Conclusions: MyBehavior is a simple-to-use mobile phone app with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, MyBehavior represents the first attempt to create personalized, contextualized, actionable suggestions automatically from self-tracked information (ie, manual food logging and automatic tracking of activity). Lessons learned about the difficulty of manual logging and usability concerns, as well as future directions, are discussed.

        "Abstract": "Background: Dashboards have been increasingly used in clinic-based interventions, such as clinical performance improvement and monitoring risk of hospital readmissions, and are now gaining traction in population-based interventions, especially in disease assessment. Objective: We describe the design, development, and usage analysis of a geovisualization dashboard, the Ending the Epidemic (ETE) Dashboard. The ETE dashboard is a tool developed to track New York's progress towards achieving the goal of its ETE Initiative, to reduce new HIV infections from 3000 per year to 750 per year by the end of 2020. Methods: The ETE dashboard was adapted from an existing human-centered geovisualization platform, SanaViz, an Internet-enabled, interactive app incorporating principles of human-centered design and cognitive fit theory to enhance visual exploration of population health data. Usage evaluation of the ETE geovisualization dashboard was conducted using Google Analytics over a 4-week period from March 19 to April 18, 2016. The aim was to monitor user activity and analyze traffic on the ETE dashboard using evidence-based metrics that can provide adequate feedback to enhance its utilization. Usage was characterized based on three metrics: (1) number of unique visits to each page, (2) average time on each page in seconds, and (3) page bounce rate (ie, percentage of visits where user left the site immediately after viewing just a single page). Further analysis was also conducted by cross-tabulating specific usage metrics. Results: Of 860 sessions, 324 sessions were initiated by unique users (37.7%). The most common acquisition channels included direct source (353/860, 41.0%); followed by referral traffic (340/860, 39.5%) and organic search (134/860, 15.5%). Usage statistics indicate that for the 860 sessions initiated by both new and returning users, the average viewing time was 8 minutes, 51 seconds, and the bounce rate was 46%. These statistics reflect positive results given that prior literature estimates an average session duration of 10-20 seconds and a bounce rate of 40-60% for most websites. Key findings from our study showed that the highest bounce rates were seen for the \"About\" page of the ETE website (65%), which describes the ETE initiative. The lowest bounce rates were seen for the ETE blog page (17%), consistent with prior research on website usage metrics that indicate that blog pages are often the most frequently viewed pages on Web portals. Conclusions: Our findings reveal the potential of Google Analytics as a tool to enhance user traffic and performance of the ETE geovisualization platform by using feedback from regular monitoring of key parameters including page bounce rates and average time on page. It also identifies the need for a follow-up usability assessment of the system.",

Unfortunately, most of those techniques are not applicable in the clinical environment or lack accuracy.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aimed to test the feasibility of a mobile neuroimaging-based clinical augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) framework, CLARAi, for objective pain detection and also localization direct from the patient's brain in real time.<bold>Methods: </bold>Clinical dental pain was triggered in 21 patients by hypersensitive tooth stimulation with 20 consecutive descending cold stimulations (32\u00b0C-0\u00b0C). We used a portable optical neuroimaging technology, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, to gauge their cortical activity during evoked acute clinical pain. The data were decoded using a neural network (NN)-based AI algorithm to classify hemodynamic response data into pain and no-pain brain states in real time. We tested the performance of several networks (NN with 7 layers, 6 layers, 5 layers, 3 layers, recurrent NN, and long short-term memory network) upon reorganized data features on pain diction and localization in a simulated real-time environment. In addition, we also tested the feasibility of transmitting the neuroimaging data to an AR device, HoloLens, in the same simulated environment, allowing visualization of the ongoing cortical activity on a 3-dimensional brain template virtually plotted on the patients' head during clinical consult.<bold>Results: </bold>The artificial neutral network (3-layer NN) achieved an optimal classification accuracy at 80.37% (126,000/156,680) for pain and no pain discrimination, with positive likelihood ratio (PLR) at 2.35. We further explored a 3-class localization task of left/right side pain and no-pain states, and convolutional NN-6 (6-layer NN) achieved highest classification accuracy at 74.23% (1040/1401) with PLR at 2.02.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Additional studies are needed to optimize and validate our prototype CLARAi framework for other pains and neurologic disorders.

        "Abstract": "Objectives To test the feasibility of using text mining to depict meaningfully the experience of pain in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, to identify novel pain phenotypes, and to propose methods for longitudinal visualization of pain status. Materials and methods Text from 4409 clinical encounters for 33 men enrolled in a 15-year longitudinal clinical/molecular autopsy study of metastatic prostate cancer (Project to ELIminate lethal CANcer) was subjected to natural language processing (NLP) using Unified Medical Language System-based terms. A four-tiered pain scale was developed, and logistic regression analysis identified factors that correlated with experience of severe pain during each month. Results NLP identified 6387 pain and 13 827 drug mentions in the text. Graphical displays revealed the pain 'landscape' described in the textual records and confirmed dramatically increasing levels of pain in the last years of life in all but two patients, all of whom died from metastatic cancer. Severe pain was associated with receipt of opioids (OR=6.6, p<0.0001) and palliative radiation (OR=3.4, p=0.0002). Surprisingly, no severe or controlled pain was detected in two of 33 subjects' clinical records. Additionally, the NLP algorithm proved generalizable in an evaluation using a separate data source (889 Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) discharge summaries). Discussion Patterns in the pain experience, undetectable without the use of NLP to mine the longitudinal clinical record, were consistent with clinical expectations, suggesting that meaningful NLP-based pain status monitoring is feasible. Findings in this initial cohort suggest that 'outlier' pain phenotypes useful for probing the molecular basis of cancer pain may exist. Limitations The results are limited by a small cohort size and use of proprietary NLP software. Conclusions We have established the feasibility of tracking longitudinal patterns of pain by text mining of free text clinical records. These methods may be useful for monitoring pain management and identifying novel cancer phenotypes.",

The design and construction of London Heathrow Terminal 5 are analyzed to build new theoretical understanding of visualization and materialization practices in the transition from digital design to physical realization. In the project studied, an integrated software solution is introduced as an infrastructure for delivery. The analyses articulate the work done to maintain this digital infrastructure and also to move designs beyond the closed world of a computer to a physical reality. In changing medium, engineers use heterogeneous trials to interrogate and address the limitations of an integrated digital model. The paper explains why such trials, which involve the reconciliation of digital and physical data through parallel and iterative forms of work, provide a robust practice for realizing goals that have physical outcomes. It argues that this practice is temporally different from, and at times in conflict with, building a comprehensive dataset within the digital medium. The paper concludes by discussing the implications for organizations that use digital infrastructures in seeking to accomplish goals in digital and physical media.",

While most social studies on such groups present a static view, taking a snapshot of them at a certain moment in time, this study sheds a dynamic perspective on invisible colleges and examines empirically how they evolve in the course of time. Drawing on the neo-Kuhnian sociology of science, it defines invisible colleges as communication networks and considers how their emergence and evolution is affected by the organizational features of fragmented adhocracies. The empirical aspect focuses on formal scholarly communication through publication in a sample of seven leading journals in the field of management and organization studies over three decades. The methodology is rooted in bibliometrics and combines co-citation analysis with network visualization. The resulting networks, which reflect the community structure of the field, map 40 different colleges. Seven patterns of how this nested structure evolves are derived: college appearance, transformation, drift, differentiation, fusion, implosion and revival. The paper closes with suggestions for further research on those patterns.",

Whilst the amount of digitised information is constantly increasing, so too is the pace of progress in information technology, resulting in obsolescence of the software and hardware required to access and view digital information. Despite many organisations recognising this threat and the resulting need for preservation action, more work is required to effectively address the issue. We present in this article a framework for the long-term digital preservation of 3-D data. This framework is based on two pertinent preservation practices, emulation and metadata which ensure that the authenticity and usability, respectively, of a preserved digital object remain intact through time. An evaluation of our framework is presented which illustrates the viability of our approach in retaining accessibility, authenticity and usability for future end users.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Analytics-as-a-service (AaaS) is one of the latest provisions emerging from the cloud services family. Utilizing this paradigm of computing in health informatics will benefit patients, care providers, and governments significantly. This work is a novel approach to realize health analytics as services in critical care units in particular. Objective: To design, implement, evaluate, and deploy an extendable big-data compatible framework for health-analytics-as-a-service that offers both real-time and retrospective analysis. Methods: We present a novel framework that can realize health data analytics-as-a-service. The framework is flexible and configurable for different scenarios by utilizing the latest technologies and best practices for data acquisition, transformation, storage, analytics, knowledge extraction, and visualization. We have instantiated the proposed method, through the Artemis project, that is, a customization of the framework for live monitoring and retrospective research on premature babies and ill term infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Results: We demonstrated the proposed framework in this paper for monitoring NICUs and refer to it as the Artemis-In-Cloud (Artemis-IC) project. A pilot of Artemis has been deployed in the SickKids hospital NICU. By infusing the output of this pilot set up to an analytical model, we predict important performance measures for the final deployment of Artemis-IC. This process can be carried out for other hospitals following the same steps with minimal effort. SickKids' NICU has 36 beds and can classify the patients generally into 5 different types including surgical and premature babies. The arrival rate is estimated as 4.5 patients per day, and the average length of stay was calculated as 16 days. Mean number of medical monitoring algorithms per patient is 9, which renders 311 live algorithms for the whole NICU running on the framework. The memory and computation power required for Artemis-IC to handle the SickKids NICU will be 32 GB and 16 CPU cores, respectively. The required amount of storage was estimated as 8.6 TB per year. There will always be 34.9 patients in SickKids NICU on average. Currently, 46% of patients cannot get admitted to SickKids NICU due to lack of resources. By increasing the capacity to 90 beds, all patients can be accommodated. For such a provisioning, Artemis-IC will need 16 TB of storage per year, 55 GB of memory, and 28 CPU cores. Conclusions: Our contributions in this work relate to a cloud architecture for the analysis of physiological data for clinical decisions support for tertiary care use. We demonstrate how to size the equipment needed in the cloud for that architecture based on a very realistic assessment of the patient characteristics and the associated clinical decision support algorithms that would be required to run for those patients. We show the principle of how this could be performed and furthermore that it can be replicated for any critical care setting within a tertiary institution.",

        "Abstract": "For humans and automation to collaborate and perform tasks effectively, all participants need access to a common representation of potentially relevant situational information, or context. This article describes a general framework for building context-aware interactive intelligent systems that comprises three major functions: (1) capture human-system interactions and infer implicit context; (2) analyze and predict user intent and goals; and (3) provide effective augmentation or mitigation strategies to improve performance, such as delivering timely, personalized information and recommendations, adjusting levels of automation, or adapting visualizations. Our goal is to develop an approach that enables humans to interact more intuitively and naturally with automation that is reusable across domains by modeling context and algorithms at a higher level of abstraction. We first provide an operational definition of context and discuss challenges and opportunities for exploiting context. We then describe our current work toward a general platform that supports developing context-aware applications in a variety of domains. We then explore an example use case illustrating how our framework can facilitate personalized collaboration within an information management and decision support tool. Future work includes evaluating our framework.",

        "Abstract": "As computing and network capabilities continue to rise, it becomes increasingly important to understand the varied applications for using them to provide healthcare. The objective of this review is to identify key characteristics and attributes of healthcare applications involving the use of advanced computing and communication technologies, drawing upon 45 research and development projects in telemedicine and other aspects of healthcare funded by the National Library of Medicine over the past 12 years. Only projects publishing in the professional literature were included in the review. Four projects did not publish beyond their final reports. In addition, the authors drew on their first-hand experience as project officers, reviewers and monitors of the work. Major themes in the corpus of work were identified, characterizing key attributes of advanced computing and network applications in healthcare. Advanced computing and network applications are relevant to a range of healthcare settings and specialties, but they are most appropriate for solving a narrower range of problems in each. Healthcare projects undertaken primarily to explore potential have also demonstrated effectiveness and depend on the quality of network service as much as bandwidth. Many applications are enabling, making it possible to provide service or conduct research that previously was not possible or to achieve outcomes in addition to those for which projects were undertaken. Most notable are advances in imaging and visualization, collaboration and sense of presence, and mobility in communication and information-resource use.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Comorbid anxiety and depression can add to the complexity of managing treatment for people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Monitoring mood has the potential to identify individuals who might benefit from additional support and treatment. Objective: We used data from the sElf-management anD support proGrammE (EDGE) trial to examine: (1) the extent to which the mood-monitoring components of a mobile health system for patients with COPD were used by participants; (2) the levels of anxiety and depression symptoms among study participants; (3) the extent to which videos providing advice about coping with low mood were viewed; and (4) the characteristics of participants with differing levels of mood and utilization of mood monitoring. Methods: A total of 107 men and women with a clinical diagnosis of COPD, aged \u226540 years old, were recruited to the intervention arm of the EDGE trial. Participants were invited to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 test every four weeks using a tablet computer. Mood disturbance based on these measures was defined as a score \u22655 on either scale. Participants reporting a mood disturbance were automatically directed (signposted) to a stress or mood management video. Study outcomes included measures of health status, respiratory quality of life, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Results: Overall, 94 (87.9%) participants completed the 12-month study. A total of 80 participants entered at least one response each month for at least ten months. On average, 16 participants (range 8-38 participants) entered \u22652 responses each month. Of all the participants, 47 (50%) gave responses indicating a mood disturbance. Participants with a mood disturbance score for both scales (n=47) compared with those without (n=20) had lower health status (P =.008), lower quality of life (P =.009), and greater anxiety (P <.001) and increased depression symptoms (P <.001). Videos were viewed by 64 (68%) people over 12 months. Of the 220 viewing visualizations, 70 (34.7%) began after being signposted. Participants signposted to the stress management video (100%; IQR 23.3-100%) watched a greater proportion of it compared to those not signposted (38.4%; IQR 16.0-68.1%; P =.03), whereas duration of viewing was not significantly different for the mood management video. Conclusions: Monitoring of anxiety and depression symptoms for people with COPD is feasible. More than half of trial participants reported scores indicating a mood disturbance during the study. Signposting participants to an advisory video when reporting increased symptoms of a mood disturbance resulted in a longer view-time for the stress management video. The opportunity to elicit measures of mood regularly as part of a health monitoring system could contribute to better care for people with COPD.",

Virtual Operations Support Teams (VOSTs) are a novel form of organized intelligence-gathering effort that has recently appeared in the emergency management and disaster response domain. Using novel organizational strategies and advanced algorithmic tools, such teams are set up to master the challenge of data overload and to turn it into increased situational awareness for decision-makers. This paper contains an analysis of the structural, procedural and technical requirements of VOSTs for the collaborative deployment with emergency management agencies during the Grand D\u00e9part of the Tour de France 2017 in D\u00fcsseldorf. We had the unique opportunity to participate in the creation and initial deployments of a VOST, a new team assembled by the German Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW). Based on our observations we will provide a structured investigation into the various tasks of a VOST, such as social media monitoring, information verification, and crisis mapping. Due to the specific nature of the challenges faced by a VOST, which inherently involve big data processing, we will discuss the technical requirements and future prospects of data mining tools developed for and employed within this context.",

The aim is to provide historians with tools that ease the process of handling and observation of very fragile and unique objects. By performing a three-dimensional imaging of stamps, data are processed in three different ways: (1) adaptive thresholding on the corresponding range image enables visualization for the first time of an image of the actual print produced by the stamp; (2) interactive enhanced rendering provides a realistic and non-photorealistic interactive visualization; and, finally, (3) rapid prototyping production gives a perfect geometrical facsimile of the stamps, preventing any hazards inherent in the handling of the originals.",

        "Abstract": "Measuring the relatedness between bibliometric units (journals, documents, authors, or words) is a central task in bibliometric analysis. Relatedness measures are used for many different tasks, among them the generating of maps, or visual pictures, showing the relationship between all items from these data. Despite the importance of these tasks, there has been little written on how to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of relatedness measures or the resulting maps. The authors propose a new framework for assessing the performance of relatedness measures and visualization algorithms that contains four factors: accuracy, coverage, scalability, and robustness. This method was applied to 10 measures of journal\u2013journal relatedness to determine the best measure. The 10 relatedness measures were then used as inputs to a visualization algorithm to create an additional 10 measures of journal\u2013journal relatedness based on the distances between pairs of journals in two-dimensional space. This second step determines robustness (i.e., which measure remains best after dimension reduction). Results show that, for low coverage (under 50%), the Pearson correlation is the most accurate raw relatedness measure. However, the best overall measure, both at high coverage, and after dimension reduction, is the cosine index or a modified cosine index. Results also showed that the visualization algorithm increased local accuracy for most measures. Possible reasons for this counterintuitive finding are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: The Internet is estimated to grow significantly as access to Web content in some non-English languages continues to increase. However, prior research in human\u2013computer interaction (HCI) has implicitly assumed the primary language used on the Web to be English. This assumption is not true for many non-English-speaking regions where rapidly growing on-line populations access the Web in their native languages. For example, Latin America, where the majority of people speak Spanish, will have the fastest growing population in coming decades. However, existing Spanish search engines lack search, browse, and analysis capabilities. The research reported here studied human information seeking on the non-English Web. In it we developed a Spanish business Web portal that supports searching, browsing, summarization, categorization, and visualization of Spanish business Web pages. Using 42 Spanish speakers as subjects we conducted a two-phase experiment to evaluate this portal and found that, compared with a Spanish search engine and a Spanish Web directory, it achieved significantly better user ratings on information quality, cross-regional search capability, system performance attributes, and overall satisfaction. Subjects\u2019 verbal comments strongly favored the search and browse functionality and user interface of our portal. As the Web becomes more international, this research makes three contributions: (1) an empirical evaluation of the performance level of a Spanish search portal; (2) an examination of the information quality, cross-regional search capability and usability of search engines for the non-English Web; and (3) a better understanding of non-English Web searching.",

Fomented by developments in high-throughput technologies to characterize biomolecules and their interactions, network science has emerged as one of the fastest growing areas in computational and systems biology research. Although the number of research and review articles on different aspects of network science is increasing, updated resources that provide a broad, yet concise, review of this area in the context of systems biology are few. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the research on biological networks to a general audience, who have some knowledge of biology and statistics, but are not necessarily familiar with this research field. Based on the different aspects of network science research, the article is broadly divided into four sections: (1) network construction, (2) topological analysis, (3) network and data integration, and (4) visualization tools. We specifically focused on the most widely studied types of biological networks, which are, metabolic, gene regulatory, protein-protein interaction, genetic interaction, and signaling networks. In future, with further developments on experimental and computational methods, we expect that the analysis of biological networks will assume a leading role in basic and translational research. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>The rise in popularity of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and hookah over recent years has been accompanied by some confusion and uncertainty regarding the development of an appropriate regulatory response towards these emerging products. Mining online discussion content can lead to insights into people's experiences, which can in turn further our knowledge of how to address potential health implications. In this work, we take a novel approach to understanding the use and appeal of these emerging products by applying text mining techniques to compare consumer experiences across discussion forums.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study examined content from the websites Vapor Talk, Hookah Forum, and Reddit to understand people's experiences with different tobacco products. Our investigation involves three parts. First, we identified contextual factors that inform our understanding of tobacco use behaviors, such as setting, time, social relationships, and sensory experience, and compared the forums to identify the ones where content on these factors is most common. Second, we compared how the tobacco use experience differs with combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Third, we investigated differences between e-cigarette and hookah use.<bold>Methods: </bold>In the first part of our study, we employed a lexicon-based extraction approach to estimate prevalence of contextual factors, and then we generated a heat map based on these estimates to compare the forums. In the second and third parts of the study, we employed a text mining technique called topic modeling to identify important topics and then developed a visualization, Topic Bars, to compare topic coverage across forums.<bold>Results: </bold>In the first part of the study, we identified two forums, Vapor Talk Health & Safety and the Stopsmoking subreddit, where discussion concerning contextual factors was particularly common. The second part showed that the discussion in Vapor Talk Health & Safety focused on symptoms and comparisons of combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes, and the Stopsmoking subreddit focused on psychological aspects of quitting. Last, we examined the discussion content on Vapor Talk and Hookah Forum. Prominent topics included equipment, technique, experiential elements of use, and the buying and selling of equipment.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This study has three main contributions. Discussion forums differ in the extent to which their content may help us understand behaviors with potential health implications. Identifying dimensions of interest and using a heat map visualization to compare across forums can be helpful for identifying forums with the greatest density of health information. Additionally, our work has shown that the quitting experience can potentially be very different depending on whether or not e-cigarettes are used. Finally, e-cigarette and hookah forums are similar in that members represent a \"hobbyist culture\" that actively engages in information exchange. These differences have important implications for both tobacco regulation and smoking cessation intervention design.",

We searched the Web of Science and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database for papers related to EBM. We applied information visualization techniques, citation analysis, cocitation analysis, cocitation cluster analysis, and network analysis to construct historiographies, themes networks, and chronological theme maps regarding EBM in China and the West. EBM appeared to develop in 4 stages: incubation (1972-1992 in the West vs. 1982-1999 in China), initiation (1992-1993 vs. 1999-2000), rapid development (1993-2000 vs. 2000-2004), and stable distribution (2000 onwards vs. 2004 onwards). Although there was a lag in EBM initiation in China compared with the West, the pace of development appeared similar. Our study shows that important differences exist in research themes, domain structures, and development depth, and in the speed of adoption between China and the West. In the West, efforts in EBM have shifted from education to practice, and from the quality of evidence to its translation. In China, there was a similar shift from education to practice, and from production of evidence to its translation. In addition, this concept has diffused to other healthcare areas, leading to the development of evidence-based traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based nursing, and evidence-based policy making.",

We are interested in evidence for the support of community involvement that the aggregated Web pages and social media might help to create. We collected and analyzed Twitter data related to a geographic area over a two-year period to identify and characterize relevant topics and social interactions, and to evaluate the support for community involvement that such Twitter use might indicate. This kind of data collection has built-in biases, of course, just as local print media or online newsgroups do. We analyzed our data using the open source tool NodeXL to identify topics and their changes over time, and to create social graphs based on retweets and @ mentions that suggest interactions around topics. Our findings show: 1) distinct topics, 2) large and small clusters of social interactions around a variety of topics, and 3) patterns suggesting what are called 'community clusters' and 'tight crowd' types of conversations, and 4) evidence that Twitter supports local community involvement among users. Modeling topics over time and displaying visualizations of social interactions around different topics in a community can offer insights into the important events and issues during a given period. Such visualizations also reveal hidden (or obscure) topics due to a smaller number of participants -- whether government representatives, voluntary associations, or citizens. There is clear evidence that Twitter supports social interaction and informal discussion or exchange around local topics among users, thereby facilitating community involvement.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Antimicrobial resistance has reached globally alarming levels and is becoming a major public health threat. Lack of efficacious antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems was identified as one of the causes of increasing resistance, due to the lag time between new resistances and alerts to care providers. Several initiatives to track drug resistance evolution have been developed. However, no effective real-time and source-independent antimicrobial resistance monitoring system is available publicly. Objective: To design and implement an architecture that can provide real-time and source-independent antimicrobial resistance monitoring to support transnational resistance surveillance. In particular, we investigated the use of a Semantic Web-based model to foster integration and interoperability of interinstitutional and cross-border microbiology laboratory databases. Methods: Following the agile software development methodology, we derived the main requirements needed for effective antimicrobial resistance monitoring, from which we proposed a decentralized monitoring architecture based on the Semantic Web stack. The architecture uses an ontology-driven approach to promote the integration of a network of sentinel hospitals or laboratories. Local databases are wrapped into semantic data repositories that automatically expose local computing-formalized laboratory information in the Web. A central source mediator, based on local reasoning, coordinates the access to the semantic end points. On the user side, a user-friendly Web interface provides access and graphical visualization to the integrated views. Results: We designed and implemented the online Antimicrobial Resistance Trend Monitoring System (ARTEMIS) in a pilot network of seven European health care institutions sharing 70+ million triples of information about drug resistance and consumption. Evaluation of the computing performance of the mediator demonstrated that, on average, query response time was a few seconds (mean 4.3, SD 0.1 x 10\u00b2 seconds). Clinical pertinence assessment showed that resistance trends automatically calculated by ARTEMIS had a strong positive correlation with the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net)  (p = .86, P < .001) and the Sentinel Surveillance of Antibiotic Resistance in Switzerland (SEARCH) (p = .84, P < .001) systems. Furthermore, mean resistance rates extracted by ARTEMIS were not significantly different from those of either EARS-Net (\u0394 = \u00b10.130; 95% confidence interval -0 to 0.030; P < .001) or SEARCH (\u0394 = \u00b10.042; 95% confidence interval -0.004 to 0.028; P = .004). Conclusions: We introduce a distributed monitoring architecture that can be used to build transnational antimicrobial resistance surveillance networks. Results indicated that the Semantic Web-based approach provided an efficient and reliable solution for development of eHealth architectures that enable online antimicrobial resistance monitoring from heterogeneous data sources. In future, we expect that more health care institutions can join the ARTEMIS network so that it can provide a large European and wider biosurveillance network that can be used to detect emerging bacterial resistance in a multinational context and support public health actions.",

        "Abstract": "Biomedical research is critical to biodefense, which is drawing increasing attention from governments globally as well as from various research communities. The U.S. government has been closely monitoring and regulating biomedical research activities, particularly those studying or involving bioterrorism agents or diseases. Effective surveillance requires comprehensive understanding of extant biomedical research and timely detection of new developments or emerging trends. The rapid knowledge expansion, technical breakthroughs, and spiraling collaboration networks demand greater support for literature search and sharing, which cannot be effectively supported by conventional literature search mechanisms or systems. In this study, we propose an integrated approach that integrates advanced techniques for content analysis, network analysis, and information visualization. We design and implement Arizona Literature Mapper, a Web-based portal that allows users to gain timely, comprehensive understanding of bioterrorism research, including leading scientists, research groups, institutions as well as insights about current mainstream interests or emerging trends. We conduct two user studies to evaluate Arizona Literature Mapper and include a well-known system for benchmarking purposes. According to our results, Arizona Literature Mapper is significantly more effective for supporting users' search of bioterrorism publications than PubMed. Users consider Arizona Literature Mapper more useful and easier to use than PubMed. Users are also more satisfied with Arizona Literature Mapper and show stronger intentions to use it in the future. Assessments of Arizona Literature Mapper's analysis functions are also positive, as our subjects consider them useful, easy to use, and satisfactory. Our results have important implications that are also discussed in the article.",

In this paper we focus on a specific type of technological pattern, namely the analysis of patents' positions in relation to predefined positions of application fields. For this purpose we use an anchoring approach. We apply semantic patent measurement and discuss RadViz as a powerful method to visualize the measurement's results and to provide insightful motion patterns for monitoring technology change. Moreover, we present an algorithm to define so called anchor points as high dimensional reference points by using textual elements of patents. By the example of carbon fiber reinforcements we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach. Thus, our approach enables academics to analyze important types of technological patterns like convergence or divergence by means of a new instrument and gives practitioners like the R&D management of companies the opportunity to build a reliable strategic business decision support.",

By focusing our analysis on how sociomaterial affordances emerge through the implementation, use and continued development of digital and physical visualization boards, we show how these artifacts constitute an integral part of the operational staff's sensemaking and enactment of a new institutional logic. We make two contributions. First, we show how the perceived affordances of a technology are created from the experience of using several different technologies and how the rejection of one technology can simultaneously constitute another. Second, we show how visualization artifacts, entangled in sociomaterial practices, can shape individual focus of attention and thus facilitate the integration of a new institutional logic in operational practice.",

Abstract Emerging trends in mobile edge computing for developing the efficient healthcare application such as, remote monitoring of the patients with central electronics clouds (e-Clouds) and their increasing voluminous multimedia have caught the attention of everyone in industry and academia. So, clear visualization, big sensing level, and better quality of service (QoS) is the foremost priority. This paper proposes the window-based Rate Control Algorithm (w-RCA) to optimize the medical quality of service (m-QoS) in the mobile edge computing based healthcare by considering the network parameters for instance, peak-to-mean ratio (PMR), standard deviation (Std.dev), delay and jitter during 8 min medical video stream named \"Navigation to the Uterine Horn, transection of the horn and re-anastomosis' transmission over 5 G networks. The performance of the proposed w-RCA is evaluated and compared with the conventional battery smoothing algorithm (BSA) and Baseline by using MPEG-4 encoder for optimizing m-QoS at the source or the server side. The experimental results demonstrate that the w-RCA outperforms the BSA and Baseline by optimizing QoS in remote healthcare application i.e., Tele-surgery. Besides, it is observed and analyzed that w-RCA produces better and effective results at small buffer and window sizes unlike BSA and Baseline by adopting large buffer size during QoS optimization.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose--The purpose of this article is to present a conceptual model for the design of a scholarly web portal at the University of T\u00e9bessa, with which it is hoped that scholarly work stations that combine local and remote holdings, tools and documents will be created. Today, with access to enormous quantities of information facilitated by the web, boundaries between remote and local source documents become invisible. This is of extreme interest for libraries in Algeria, whose local holdings are very limited. Design/methodology/approach--An outlined conceptual model of library portal architecture, with ontological classifications and relationships is presented. The model comes from applying literature reviews to the needs and specifications of the authors and leads to a detailed breakdown of the planning and implementation process. Findings--Three findings in particular are worth noting. First, the contribution of web services to the seamless utility of a scholarly portal is indispensable: interoperable features, formats and protocols can be carefully customized. Second, the conceptual model assists not only in visualization but in implementation phases of the process from assessment of user needs and behaviors through interface creation and ongoing maintenance. Third, a method for recycling (or \"porting\") existing applications in constructing new library services is a key component. Originality/value--Though this library portal is conceived for an Algerian library, which will ultimately benefit from inclusion in a nationwide network, R\u00e9seau Regional Inter Biblioth\u00e8ques Universitaires (RIBU), the conceptual model may guide anyone interested in aggregating online information resources into a single, seamless terminal.",

The 3D widgets instantiated in these applications are synchronized between clients in order to facilitate the high degree of interactivity necessary for productive investigation of shared medical models and volume data. We discuss challenges that face the investigator in an immersive 3D environment as opposed to that of a 2D desktop environment. We describe how these differences have led us to criteria for development of the shared 3D Virtual Reality (VR) graphical user interfaces (GUIs) used in the biomedical applications presented. We review our educational validations already conducted for the surface model exploration application and preview our future work toward a single advanced biomedical collaboration environment.",

The tool allows to structure the set of documents in a hierarchical way (using a fuzzy hierarchical structure) and represent this structure in a graphical interface (a 3D sphere) over which the user can navigate. Gambal allows the analysis of the documents and the computation of their similarity not only on the basis of the syntactic similarity between words but also based on a dictionary (Wordnet 1.7) and latent semantics analysis.",

The results show that observers like the images on autostereoscopic 3D displays slightly more than those presented by means of 2D displays. On both displays the product is perceived more quickly when it is larger than the other elements and is shown with greater chromatic contrast, but a composition is seen as more attractive when the chromatic relationship between all the elements is more harmonious.",

        "Abstract": "Various accessibility activities are improving blind access to the increasingly indispensable WWW. These approaches use various metrics to measure the Web's accessibility. \"Ease of navigation\" (navigability) is one of the crucial factors for blind usability, especially for complicated webpages used in portals and online shopping sites. However, it is difficult for automatic checking tools to evaluate the navigation capabilities even for a single webpage. Navigability issues for complete Web applications are still far beyond their capabilities. This study aims at obtaining quantitative results about the current accessibility status of real world Web applications, and analyzes real users' behavior on such websites. In Study 1, an automatic analysis method for webpage navigability is introduced, and then a broad survey using this method for 30 international online shopping sites is described. The next study (Study 2) focuses on a fine-rained analysis of real users' behavior on some of these online shopping sites. We modified a voice browser to record each user's actions and the information presented to that user. We conducted user testing on existing sites with this tool. We also developed an analysis and visualization method for the recorded information. The results showed us that users strongly depend on scanning navigation instead of logical navigation. A landmark-oriented navigation model was proposed based on the results. Finally, we discuss future possibilities for improving navigability, including proposals for voice browsers.",

        "Abstract": "The amount of health information available on the Internet is considerable. In this context, several health gateways have been developed. Among them, CISMeF (Catalogue and Index of Health Resources in French) was designed to catalogue and index health resources in French. The goal of this article is to describe the various enhancements to the MeSH thesaurus developed by the CISMeF team to adapt this terminology to the broader field of health Internet resources instead of scientific articles for themedlinebibliographic database. CISMeF uses two standard tools for organizing information: the MeSH thesaurus and several metadata element sets, in particular the Dublin Core metadata format. The heterogeneity of Internet health resources led the CISMeF team to enhance the MeSH thesaurus with the introduction of two new concepts, respectively, resource types and metaterms. CISMeF resource types are a generalization of the publication types ofmedline. A resource type describes the nature of the resource and MeSH keyword/qualifier pairs describe the subject of the resource. A metaterm is generally a medical specialty or a biological science, which has semantic links with one or more MeSH keywords, qualifiers and resource types. The CISMeF terminology is exploited for several tasks: resource indexing performed manually, resource categorization performed automatically, visualization and navigation through the concept hierarchies and information retrieval using the Doc\u2019CISMeF search engine. The CISMeF health gateway uses several MeSH thesaurus enhancements to optimize information retrieval, hierarchy navigation and automatic indexing.",

This paper proposes a new method termed Treeview self-organising maps (Treeview SOMs) for clustering and organising text documents by means of a series of independently and automatically created, hierarchical one-dimensional SOMs. The method generates a topological taxonomy tree for a set of unstructured text documents in terms of presentation and visualisation. The documents are organised in a hierarchy of dynamically generated and automatically validated topics extracted from the corpus of the documents. The results presented in a labelled tree view, clearly show underlying contents of the documents and can help browsing the document set more efficiently than those of previous work using SOMs or hierarchical clustering methods. A brief overview on general document clustering and a review on SOM-based document analysis methods are also provided together with a comparison among them.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: Blogs, often treated as the equivalence of online personal diaries, have become one of the fastest growing types of Web-based media. Everyone is free to express their opinions and emotions very easily through blogs. In the blogosphere, many communities have emerged, which include hate groups and racists that are trying to share their ideology, express their views, or recruit new group members. It is important to analyze these virtual communities, defined based on membership and subscription linkages, in order to monitor for activities that are potentially harmful to society. While many Web mining and network analysis techniques have been used to analyze the content and structure of the Web sites of hate groups on the Internet, these techniques have not been applied to the study of hate groups in blogs. To address this issue, we have proposed a semi-automated approach in this research. The proposed approach consists of four modules, namely blog spider, information extraction, network analysis, and visualization. We applied this approach to identify and analyze a selected set of 28 anti-Blacks hate groups (820 bloggers) on Xanga, one of the most popular blog hosting sites. Our analysis results revealed some interesting demographical and topological characteristics in these groups, and identified at least two large communities on top of the smaller ones. The study also demonstrated the feasibility in applying the proposed approach in the study of hate groups and other related communities in blogs.",

        "Abstract": "Handheld displays leave little space for the visualization and navigation of spatial layouts representing rich information spaces. The most common navigation method for handheld displays is static peephole navigation: The peephole is static and we move the spatial layout behind it (scrolling). A more natural method is dynamic peephole navigation: here, the spatial layout is static and we move the peephole across it. In the experiment reported here, we compared dynamic and static peephole navigation in otherwise similar conditions. Subjects viewed a spatial layout containing two lines on a static display screen. Only a part of the screen--the peephole---was visible. Subjects had to discriminate line length by either moving a dynamic peephole across a static layout of the lines or by moving a dynamic layout behind a static peephole. In both conditions, they used mouse-cursor control to move either the peephole or the lines. Results show significant differences in discrimination performance between conditions when lines are larger than the size of the peephole. Discrimination thresholds for static peephole navigation were 50-75% higher than for dynamic peephole navigation. Furthermore, static peephole navigation took 24% more time than dynamic peephole navigation.",

        "Abstract": "\u2022 The quantitative analysis in terms of topic words and their correlation for mining and analysis of foreign relations is lacked and needed. \u2022 A framework for studying foreign relations is proposed and tested with British parliamentary texts. \u2022 Five communities are identified and the distribution of topics related to China is extremely unbalanced and highly concentrated. \u2022 Evolution patterns of main topics are widely different in terms of continuity and development trends. \u2022 The case study on UK-China relations contribute to deepen the understanding of international relations between the two countries, so as to provide valuable references and suggestions for the government and researchers. Parliamentary texts are records of discussions of domestic and international affairs, which reflect national attitudes and development trends in foreign relations. In this paper, a research framework is proposed to analyze foreign relations on the basis of parliamentary texts. First, topic words are extracted from parliamentary texts, and then a co-word network is constructed to represent the correlation structure of topic words. The basic statistics, calculation of network indicators, community detection, and visualization of network maps and evolution venation, as well as the depiction of a strategic diagram, elucidate deeper characteristics and connotations of foreign relations. This case study on UK-China relations during the period of 2011-2017 using British parliamentary texts reveals the following findings. Over this period, UK-China relations changed in terms of the topics involved, topics which are greatly unbalanced in distribution, but are quite concentrated. Five different directions exist, centering on Trade, Human rights, Nuclear, Steel, and Visa. The evolution of topics includes merging and differentiation. A minority of topics exhibit marked continuity, which constitute the main focal points discussed each year, such as Economy and Trade. Regarding development trends, themes related to trade and steel remain focal points in UK-China relations. Overall, the framework proposed in this paper is proven to be both effective and feasible, and its application through this case study can foster a deeper understanding of the status and development of UK-China relations.",

In this paper, we describe DelosDLMS that takes into account the recommendations of several activities that were initiated by DELOS including the DELOS vision for digital libraries (DLs). A key aspect of DelosDLMS is its novel generic infrastructure that allows the generation of digital library systems out of a set of basic system services and DL services in a modular and extensible way. DL services like feature extraction, visualization, intelligent browsing, media-type-specific indexing, support for multilinguality, relevance feedback and many others can easily be incorporated or replaced. A further key aspect of DelosDLMS is its robustness against failures and its scalability for large collections and many parallel user requests. We discuss the current status of an effort to build DelosDLMS, a Digital Library Management System that integrates in various ways several components developed by DELOS members and showcases a great variety of functionality that is outlined as part of the DELOS vision.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "The goal of this paper is to describe an exploration system for large image databases in order to help the user understand the database as a whole, discover hidden relationships, and formulate insights with minimum effort. While the proposed system works with any type of low-level feature representation of images, we describe our system using color information. The system is built in three stages: the feature extraction stage in which images are represented in a way that allows efficient storage and retrieval results closer to the human perception; the second stage consists of building a hierarchy of clusters in which the cluster prototype, as the electronic identification (eID) of that cluster, is designed to summarize the cluster in a manner that is suited for quick human comprehension of its components. In a formal definition, an electronic IDentification (eID) is the most similar image to the other images from a corresponding cluster; that is, the image in the cluster that maximizes the sum of the squares of the similarity values to the other images of that cluster. Besides summarizing the image database to a certain level of detail, an eID image will be a way to provide access either to another set of eID images on a lower level of the hierarchy or to a group of perceptually similar images with itself. As a third stage, the multi-dimensional scaling technique is used to provide us with a tool for the visualization of the database at different levels of details. Moreover, it gives the capability for semi-automatic annotation in the sense that the image database is organized in such a way that perceptual similar images are grouped together to form perceptual contexts. As a result, instead of trying to give all possible meanings to an image, the user will interpret and annotate an image in the context in which that image appears, thus dramatically reducing the time taken to annotate large collection of images.",

But even these have become overwhelmed by sheer numbers, resulting in underused and 'orphaned' collections. Are there ways to relieve us of this burden other than through traditional library tools? Much research is being done in the visualization of text-, audio-, and video-based resources in such a way that an overview of the volume of metadata and information, and the tools to navigate them, can be created. But visualization requires a different mindset from those that have created and now use present-day interfaces.

        "Abstract": "Today\u2019s patterns of work are very much defined by the \u2018lean enterprise\u2019 practice, taking form in organizations that are more competitive, customer-driven and agile on the one hand (Womack, J. P., & Jones, D. T. (2007). Lean Solutions. New York: Simon & Schuster), and the separation of work from time and space on the other (Hochschild, A.\u00a0(1997). The time bind. New\u00a0York, NY: Metropolitan Books). Concepts like work and workspace are subject to an evolving nature and get a new meaning (Kirsh, D.\u00a0(2000). A few thoughts on cognitive overload. Intellectia, 1(30), 19-51). This triggered the rise of new working spaces, fuelled by the aftermath of the global economic crisis that transformed the practices and meanings of work. Nevertheless, this applies only to particular sectors. This paper builds on the case of Genk, an important economic pole in the Limburg Region of Belgium. The development in the region has always been related to labour-intensive industrial activities. In light of these working shifts targeting mainly big companies/employers, Genk has turned a blind eye on the local proprietors. What about the small entrepreneurs/community economies addressing mainly the local clientele? What evolution do we see in their working pattern? By using a specific visualization tool, a series of interviews were conducted in order to explore in a playful way, existing social and economic networks. The interviews reveal networks that shape a coworking model. The paper will further present the scale of this \u2018coworking\u2019 phenomenon experienced in Genk, perceived to be the \u2018new model of coworking\u2019 in the context of the collaborative and sharing economy.",

Support resulted in faster navigation, more use of artwork specifically installed to aid wayfinding, fewer navigation errors, less disorientation and less anxiety. In addition, participants used different strategies for wayfinding: without navigation support they used signs and route colour, but with navigation support they used not only the artwork, but also the existing furniture and other landmarks.

However, imbalances are present in funding policies and therefore benchmarking becomes increasingly important in health services research. Methods: The present study assessed benchmarking approaches. Using large data base analyses, research was analyzed for different health research output parameters. The fields of cardiovascular and respiratory medicine served as models to assess irregular patterns of health research. For visualization, density equalizing mapping procedures were used. Results: Specific areas of major research activity were identified for European countries and large differences were found. Spatial distribution of published items for cardiac and cardiovascular systems differed in comparison to the distribution for the respiratory system. In general, large countries dominated the overall number of published items. When qualitative measures such as citation analysis were assessed, differing results were achieved. In this category, mostly Scandinavian countries dominated. Conclusion: The present approach of comparative output benchmarking can be used to assess institutional operating figures at the national and international level and to analyze imbalances in health and research funding.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract. The Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory (HCIL) of the University of Maryland and NASA have collaborated over three years to refine and apply user interface research concepts developed at HCIL in order to improve the usability of NASA data services. The research focused on dynamic query user interfaces, visualization, and overview + preview designs. An operational prototype, using query previews, was implemented with NASA's Global Change Master Directory (GCMD), a directory service for earth science datasets. Users can see the histogram of the data distribution over several attributes and choose among attribute values. A result bar shows the cardinality of the result set, thereby preventing users from submitting queries that would have zero hits. Our experience confirmed the importance of metadata accuracy and completeness. The query preview interfaces make visible the problems or gaps in the metadata that are undetectable with classic form fill-in interfaces. This could be seen ms a problem, but we think that it will have a long-term beneficial effect on the quality of the metadata as data providers will be compelled to produce more complete and accurate metadata. The adaptation of the research prototype to the NASA data required revised data structures and algorithms.",

        "Abstract": "Web 2.0 software, in particular wikis, have the potential to allow students to become active contributors to the Internet and, as a result, restructure traditional learning environments. In this study, the effects of student-created wikis were evaluated through measures of student engagement, cognitive benefits, and student learning in both the short and long term. Data suggest that the use of wikis facilitated a pedagogical shift from traditional teacher-centered instructional approaches to student-oriented, constructivist learning, which resulted in increased student self-efficacy and motivation. Additionally, in interviews eight months following the project implementation, students who had created wikis demonstrated greater content retention and understanding than peers who had learned the same content through teacher-directed instruction. The long-term cognitive value of the wikis positively impacted student understanding by helping students to link content, both literally and figuratively, and develop a deeper understanding of content through visualization of the chronology of events as well as cause and effect relationships.",

        "Abstract": "Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) effectively solve several complex optimization problems with two or three objectives. However, when they are applied to many\u2010objective optimization, that is, when more than three criteria are simultaneously considered, the performance of most MOEAs is severely affected. Several alternatives have been reported to reproduce the same performance level that MOEAs have achieved in problems with up to three objectives when considering problems with higher dimensions. This work briefly reviews the main search difficulties, visualization, evaluation of algorithms, and new procedures in many\u2010objective optimization using evolutionary methods. Approaches for the development of evolutionary many\u2010objective algorithms are classified into: (a) based on preference relations, (b) aggregation\u2010based, (c) decomposition\u2010based, (d) indicator\u2010based, and (e) based on dimensionality reduction. The analysis of the reviewed works indicates the promising future of such methods, especially decomposition\u2010based approaches; however, much still need to be done to develop more robust, faster, and predictable evolutionary many\u2010objective algorithms. This article is categorized under: Technologies > Computational Intelligence Several important problems require to optimize four or more objectives, evolutionary algorithms are a viable alternative to deal with them.",

However, when teachers include OCW in their teaching, they often report fewer positive student engagement. This paper proposes a novel OCW tool called Cooperpad, with a group awareness functionality, which continuously gathers group members' writing behavior, analyzes and visualize their engagement intensity for group members to compare their participation with that of others. Using direct observations, a post-test-only design with an experimental group (N\u202f=\u202f72) and a control group (N\u202f=\u202f48), we have examined whether access to Cooperpad's group awareness function showed more engagement in a group-writing task than students without access to the tool. Results of direct observation indicate that Cooperpad with the group awareness support increases students' behavioral engagement, compared with a common synchronous OCW tool (without visualization support). In addition, the results show that the quality of writing in the experiment group is significantly greater than that of the control group when performing difficult tasks.",

These networks may represent the social structure of a community of researchers or knowledge transmission in a specific country or economic sector. Cuban biopharmaceutical industry is an exceptional case study. This high-tech sector has achieved important development in the context of a \u201cThird World\u201d country, with a different political organization from the rest of the world. The main goal of this work is to characterize the Cuban biotechnology industry using collaborative networks. WoS database (1969-2016) was used and metric indicators of scientific collaboration obtained from the affiliation field. Netlike visualizations were produced with NodeXL software. BioCubaFarma meets about 50% of the total scientific production of all Cuban sectors. Since its foundation, the sector has maintained significant internal and external collaboration, with Europe, Latin America and the United States of America. The United States collaboration has been significant in the absence of diplomatic relations with that country. Collaboration is greater among centers of the old \u201cscientific pole\u201d than among old companies of the pharmaceutical sector. Moreover, there is a correlation between the magnitude of the scientific production and the collaboration levels. For the development of biomedicine in Cuba, collaboration has not been solely endogenous but has also represented a significant transfer of knowledge between Cuba and other countries.",

This paper describes an approach to establish image categories automatically by unsupervised learning. The method works free of context and previous knowledge: in a first stage, features are formed automatically, then images are clustered to form categories. The human database designer has to decide only whether a category is useful or too inhomogeneous from a high level point of view. To collect images that cannot be categorized automatically, an additional \u2018miscellaneous\u2019 category exists. Categories are visualized by displaying the most typical image(s) of the categories as thumbnails. The main benefit of the approach is that it deals with color and shape in a unified way on a local scale, combined with the advantages of histogram techniques on the global scale. To judge results, an evaluation scheme which is adequate for the task of categorization is proposed.",

In this paper, we investigate the issues of performance management in large scale, autonomous and federated digital library systems, performing the tasks of indexing, searching and retrieval of information objects. We have defined a management architecture and performance framework for measuring and monitoring the behavior of digital libraries as they operate. Our architecture and mechanisms are easily applicable to other digital library systems of similar flavor and architecture. We implemented this architecture over a testbed of Dienst servers using real data and workload from the operational NCSTRL system. We have defined the relevant parameters for investigating the performance of the servers and have developed visualization tools to monitor the parameters. In addition, our performance framework provides mechanisms for load-balancing search requests in a network of digital library servers. We have demonstrated this by building a testbed for investigating a few novel load balancing policies. Given that network delays and outages are unpredictable over the Internet, we have developed new adaptive mechanisms to detect timeouts and provide quality of service.",

Design/methodology/approach - The development of the framework is driven by three motivating challenges: capturing the collective intelligence of science, fostering scientific discoveries in science and e-Science, and facilitating evidence-based librarianship (EBL). The framework is built on concepts such as structural holes and intellectual turning points, methodologies and techniques for progressive knowledge domain visualization and differentiation of conflicting opinions, and information integration models to achieve coherent transitions between different conceptual scales. Findings - Structural holes and turning points are detected and validated with the domain of terrorism research as an example. Conflicting opinions are differentiated in the form of a decision tree of phrases with the greatest information gains. Fundamental issues concerning the reliability of common assumptions across multiple levels of granularity are identified. Knowledge diffusion is studied in terms of information integration between a geographic space and an intellectual space. Research limitations/implications - This study characterizes a holistic sense-making approach with three exemplar themes. Future research is needed to develop theoretical foundations and corresponding techniques to sustain additional themes. Practical implications - The work contributes to the practice of improving our understanding of the collective intelligence in science. Originality/value - The value of the work is the conceptual and methodological contributions to address various phenomena across micro- and macroscopic levels.",

Our results show that there are mainly two groups relating to service innovation. Knowledge in these areas has been growing rapidly in recent years. In particular, the fields of ecosystem and IT & Web are exhibiting high growth. We also demonstrated that the global network of knowledge is formed around the powerful hub of the US. The research competency of Asian countries lags behind that of the US and EU. With respect to research collaboration, we identify room for enhancing international collaboration. Our methodology could be useful in forming policies to promote service innovation. Finally, we propose the creation of an international collaboration fund.",

Previous research has not addressed the evaluation of digitized versions of three-dimensional objects. This paper first reviews research concerning such digitization, in both two and three dimensions, as well as public access in this context. Next, evaluation criteria for websites incorporating digital versions of three-dimensional objects are extrapolated from previous research. Finally, five websites are evaluated, and suggestions for best practices to provide public access to digital versions of three-dimensional objects are proposed.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: The rapid growth of patent documents has called for the development of sophisticated patent analysis tools. Currently, there are various tools that are being utilized by organizations for analyzing patents. These tools are capable of performing wide range of tasks, such as analyzing and forecasting future technological trends, conducting strategic technology planning, detecting patent infringement, determining patents quality and the most promising patents, and identifying technological hotspots and patent vacuums. This literature review presents the state-of-the-art in patent analysis and also presents taxonomy of patent analysis techniques. Moreover, the key features and weaknesses of the discussed tools and techniques are presented and several directions for future research are highlighted. The literature review will be helpful for the researchers in finding the latest research efforts pertaining to the patent analysis in a unified form.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Pain is the most common physical symptom requiring medical care, yet the current methods for assessing pain are sorely inadequate. Pain assessment tools can be either too simplistic or take too long to complete to be useful for point-of-care diagnosis and treatment.<bold>Objective: </bold>The aim was to develop and test Painimation, a novel tool that uses graphic visualizations and animations instead of words or numeric scales to assess pain quality, intensity, and course. This study examines the utility of abstract animations as a measure of pain.<bold>Methods: </bold>Painimation was evaluated in a chronic pain medicine clinic. Eligible patients were receiving treatment for pain and reported pain more days than not for at least 3 months. Using a tablet computer, participating patients completed the Painimation instrument, the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), and the PainDETECT questionnaire for neuropathic symptoms.<bold>Results: </bold>Participants (N=170) completed Painimation and indicated it was useful for describing their pain (mean 4.1, SE 0.1 out of 5 on a usefulness scale), and 130 of 162 participants (80.2%) agreed or strongly agreed that they would use Painimation to communicate with their providers. Animations selected corresponded with pain adjectives endorsed on the MPQ. Further, selection of the electrifying animation was associated with self-reported neuropathic pain (r=.16, P=.03), similar to the association between neuropathic pain and PainDETECT (r=.17, P=.03). Painimation was associated with PainDETECT (r=.35, P<.001).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Using animations may be a faster and more patient-centered method for assessing pain and is not limited by age, literacy level, or language; however, more data are needed to assess the validity of this approach. To establish the validity of using abstract animations (\"painimations\") for communicating and assessing pain, apps and other digital tools using painimations will need to be tested longitudinally across a larger pain population and also within specific, more homogenous pain conditions.",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Continuous patient monitoring has been described by the World Health Organization as extremely important and is widely used in anesthesia, intensive care medicine, and emergency medicine. However, current state-of-the-art number- and waveform-based monitoring does not ideally support human users in acquiring quick, confident interpretations with low cognitive effort, and there are additional problematic aspects such as alarm fatigue. We developed a visualization technology (Visual Patient), specifically designed to help caregivers gain situation awareness quickly, which presents vital sign information in the form of an animated avatar of the monitored patient. We suspected that because of the way it displays the information as large, colorful, moving graphic objects, caregivers might be able to perform patient monitoring using their peripheral vision, which may facilitate quicker detection of anomalies, independently of acoustic alarms.<bold>Objective: </bold>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that avatar-based monitoring, when observed with peripheral vision only, increases the number of perceptible changes in patient status as well as caregivers' perceived diagnostic confidence compared with a high-fidelity simulation of conventional monitoring, when observed with peripheral vision only.<bold>Methods: </bold>We conducted a multicenter comparative study with a within-participant design in which anesthesiologists with their peripheral field of vision looked at 2 patient-monitoring scenarios and tried to identify changes in patient status. To ensure the best possible experimental conditions, we used an eye tracker, which recorded the eye movements of the participants and confirmed that they only looked at the monitoring scenarios with their peripheral vision.<bold>Results: </bold>Overall, 30 participants evaluated 18 different patient status changes with each technology (avatar and conventional patient monitoring). With conventional patient monitoring, participants could only detect those 3 changes in patient status that are associated with a change in the auditory pulse tone display, that is, tachycardia (faster beeping), bradycardia (slower beeping), and desaturation (lower pitch of beeping). With the avatar, the median number of detected vital sign changes quadrupled from 3 to 12 (P<.001) in scenario 1, and more than doubled from 3 to 8 (P<.001) in scenario 2. Median perceived diagnostic confidence was confident for both scenarios with the avatar and unconfident in scenario 1 (P<.001), and very unconfident in scenario 2 (P=.024) with conventional monitoring.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This study introduces the concept of peripheral vision monitoring. The test performed showed clearly that an avatar-based display is superior to a standard numeric display for peripheral vision. Avatar-based monitoring could potentially make much more of the patient monitoring information available to caregivers for longer time periods per case. Our results indicate that the optimal information transmission would consist of a combination of auditory and avatar-based monitoring.",

        "Abstract": "Background: In a pain drawing (PD), the patient shades or marks painful areas on an illustration of the human body. This simple yet powerful tool captures essential aspects of the subjective pain experience, such as localization, intensity, and distribution of pain, and enables the extraction of meaningful information, such as pain area, widespreadness, and segmental pattern. Starting as a simple pen-on-paper tool, PDs are now sophisticated digital health applications paving the way for many new and exciting basic translational and clinical applications. Objective: Grasping the full potential of digital PDs and laying the groundwork for future medical PD apps requires an understanding of the methodological developments that have shaped our current understanding of uses and design. This review presents methodological milestones in the development of both pen-on-paper and digital PDs, thereby offering insight into future possibilities created by the transition from paper to digital. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search covering PD acquisition , conception of PDs , PD analysis , and PD visualization. Results: The literature search yielded 435 potentially relevant papers, from which 53 methodological milestones were identified. These milestones include, for example, the grid method to quantify pain area, the pain-frequency maps, and the use of artificial neural networks to facilitate diagnosis. Conclusions: Digital technologies have had a significant influence on the evolution of PDs, whereas their versatility is leading to ever new applications in the field of medical apps and beyond. In this process, however, there is a clear need for better standardization and a re-evaluation of methodological and technical limitations that no longer apply today.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown that hybrid clustering methods based on textual and citation information outperforms clustering methods that use only one of these components. However, former methods focus on the vector space model. In this paper we apply a hybrid clustering method which is based on the graph model to map the Web of Science database in the mirror of the journals covered by the database. Compared with former hybrid clustering strategies, our method is very fast and even achieves better clustering accuracy. In addition, it detects the number of clusters automatically and provides a top-down hierarchical analysis, which fits in with the practical application. We quantitatively and qualitatively asses the added value of such an integrated analysis and we investigate whether the clustering outcome provides an appropriate representation of the field structure by comparing with a text-only or citation-only clustering and with another hybrid method based on linear combination of distance matrices. Our dataset consists of about 8,000 journals published in the period 2002-2006. The cognitive analysis, including the ranked journals, term annotation and the visualization of cluster structure demonstrates the efficiency of our strategy.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Physical activity is an important aspect in the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or type-2 diabetes. A monitoring and feedback tool combined with guidance by a primary care provider might be a successful method to enhance the level of physical activity in these patients. As a prerequisite for useful technology, it is important to involve the end-users in the design process from an early stage. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the user requirements for a tool to stimulate physical activity, embedded in primary care practice. The leading principle of this tool is to change behavior by self-monitoring, goal-setting, and feedback. Methods: The research team collected qualitative data among 15 patients, 16 care professionals, and several experts. A prototype was developed in three stages. In stage 1, the literature was searched to identify end-users and context. In stage 2, the literature, experts and patient representatives were consulted to set up a use case with the general idea of the innovation. In stage 3, individual interviews and focus groups were held to identify the end-user requirements. Based on these requirements a prototype was built by the engineering team. Results: The development process has led to a tool that generally meets the requirements of the end-users. A tri-axial activity sensor, worn on the hip, is connected by Bluetooth to a smartphone. In an app, quantitative feedback is given about the amount of activity and goals reached by means of graphical visualization, and an image shows a sun when the goal is reached. Overviews about activity per half an hour, per day, week, and month are provided. In the menu of the app and on a secured website, patients can enter information in individual sessions or read feedback messages generated by the system. The practice nurse can see the results of all patients on a secure webpage and can then discuss the results and set personalized goals in consultation with the patient. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a user-centered approach brings in valuable details (such as the requirements for feedback in activity minutes per day) to improve the fit between the user, technology, and the organization of care, which is important for the usability and acceptability of the tool. The tool embedded in primary care will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. (JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2013;1(2):e8)",

        "Abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Web-based analysis of search queries has become a very useful method in various academic fields for understanding timely and regional differences in the public interest in certain terms and concepts. Particularly in health and medical research, Google Trends has been increasingly used over the last decade.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aimed to assess the search activity of pain-related parameters on Google Trends from among the most populated regions worldwide over a 3-year period from before the report of the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in these regions (January 2018) until December 2020.<bold>Methods: </bold>Search terms from the following regions were used for the analysis: India, China, Europe, the United States, Brazil, Pakistan, and Indonesia. In total, 24 expressions of pain location were assessed. Search terms were extracted using the local language of the respective country. Python scripts were used for data mining. All statistical calculations were performed through exploratory data analysis and nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests.<bold>Results: </bold>Although the overall search activity for pain-related terms increased, apart from pain entities such as headache, chest pain, and sore throat, we observed discordant search activity. Among the most populous regions, pain-related search parameters for shoulder, abdominal, and chest pain, headache, and toothache differed significantly before and after the first officially confirmed COVID-19 cases (for all, P<.001). In addition, we observed a heterogenous, marked increase or reduction in pain-related search parameters among the most populated regions.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>As internet searches are a surrogate for public interest, we assume that our data are indicative of an increased incidence of pain after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as these increased incidences vary across geographical and anatomical locations, our findings could potentially facilitate the development of specific strategies to support the most affected groups.",

        "Abstract": "The existence of many minority languages is threatened by language shift, whereby the community of speakers moves to using the majority language in place of the minority language. Social network sites such as Facebook might be important environments for minority language maintenance, as networks of strong ties may help speakers resist pressures towards language shift. However, to date, there has been little research that investigates this aspect of minority languages' online presence. This paper presents an initial examination of the current use of the Welsh language on Facebook. The paper introduces a method for sampling the network of groups being used by a language community, based on the 'Related Groups' information within Facebook group profiles. Basic information is presented about the use of Welsh in Facebook groups, including membership numbers, the range of topics, and the levels of activity. Visualizations of the network reveal a small number of popular central groups playing a significant role in connecting the community. The successive removal of central groups results in a relatively sparsely connected network and reveals a number of geographical neighbourhood and topic-specific sub-networks. The use of Welsh on personal profiles is also examined, as are the demographics of Welsh speakers on Facebook. The results of this examination provide evidence that suggests that the use of the Welsh language has been normalized to some extent within Facebook and that the language has established an active presence on Facebook groups and profiles.",

This study was therefore undertaken in order to identify appropriate interventions and propose design guidelines for information visualisation, especially in applications where size judgement is critical. The colour size illusion was replicated on an LCD monitor, revealing that yellow images appeared the smallest among a series of red, yellow, green and blue images on a white background. Three types of interventions (background brightness, border colour and background grid brightness) were tested to identify conditions that reduce the colour illusions, but none proved to be statistically significant. Based on these experimental results and an extensive literature survey, a set of design guidelines is proposed to enhance the usability of LCD monitors and a set of design recommendations given to extend these guidelines to applications in the field of bioinformatics. These design recommendations are accompanied by an evaluation of effectiveness obtained by interviewing domain experts.",

        "Abstract": "The availability of advanced software and less expensive hardware allows museums to preserve and share artefacts digitally. As a result, museums are frequently making their collections accessible online as interactive, 3D models. This could lead to the unique situation of viewing the digital artefact before the physical artefact. Experiencing artefacts digitally outside of the museum on personal devices may affect the user's ability to emotionally connect to the artefacts. This study examines how two target populations of young adults (18\u201321 years) and the elderly (65 years and older) responded to seeing cultural heritage artefacts in three different modalities: augmented reality on a tablet, 3D models on a laptop, and then physical artefacts. Specifically, the time spent, enjoyment, and emotional responses were analysed. Results revealed that regardless of age, the digital modalities were enjoyable and encouraged emotional responses. Seeing the physical artefacts after the digital ones did not lessen their enjoyment or emotions felt. These findings aim to provide an insight into the effectiveness of 3D artefacts viewed on personal devices and artefacts shown outside of the museum for encouraging emotional responses from older and younger people.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, the different computer tools available enable designers to create complex industrial prototypes. The use of these tools is constrained by the limitations imposed by common devices, such as screens and displays. Recently emerged virtual and augmented reality techniques have started being used as supports in many learning and industrial environments. Beyond the new possibilities that these tools offer for designing industrial objects, the underlying question is whether these new technologies could improve the creativity of designers to enable them to get a better understanding of the designing process itself. This paper presents a methodological proposal for the deployment of an industrial design engineering course aimed not only at learning different design techniques, but also at assessing the creativity skills of students. The practical contents include the use of virtual reality devices, to help the designer overcome the limitations of prototype visualisation and make better designing decisions. Moreover, a creativity test will be performed at the beginning and at the end of the course to assess the changes in creativity skills taking place within the experiment group versus the changes in a traditional learning (control) group.",

In this paper, we analyse how VR characteristics can be explored using semiotic theory and, with methods of generative semiotics, we explore aspects of narrative and interaction in VR. We propose a semiotic analysis of VR communication focusing on syntax, semantics and pragmatics and considering also some principles of generative semiotics. The syntactic level is analysed as determined by the characteristics of the visual communication adopted. The semantic of VR is related to the functional model chosen to realise the virtual system. The pragmatic of VR is based on the human\u2013computer interaction that changes the user's role. We explore how these aspects can be characterised in the context of VR communication design and what principles can be adopted for a VR application, and we present an analysis and a classification of the iconic signs that are being used in VR. Moreover, we present a framework that can be used to classify and describe different kinds of virtual reality systems and to better understand communication in VR, and we use it to classify eight popular systems for e-learning and collaboration.",

        "Abstract": "\u2022 We propose the shallowest-possible, and perhaps the shallowest-ever, convolutional neural network model that can predict emotions from real-life, noisy, laggy, internet-based (in-the-wild) videos real-time, capturing nuances of emotions, i.e. value- and time-continuous affect prediction. The research we present in this paper is directly relevant to healthcare for applications such as real-time patient monitoring, AI-assisted doctor-patient consultations. \u2022 The proposed models are computationally inexpensive, can be embedded into devices such as smartglasses. \u2022 We use a novel feature selection paradigm that is driven by feature attribution score computations. \u2022 We investigate and reason the AI performance, present computations on how exactly it utilises the input features to make affect-related predictions (Explainable AI). \u2022 We compute the relevance and utilisation of facial action unit (FAU)-derived features by the model, comparing it against the human perception of emotion expression. \u2022 We extend this FAU-based 'affect' prediction approach to the FAU-based 'pain-intensity' prediction problem. \u2022 As FAUs can be extracted in near real-time, and because the models we developed are exceptionally shallow, this study paves the way for a robust, cross-cultural, end-to-end, in-the-wild real-time affect and pain prediction, that is also (nuanced or) value- and time-continuous. A robust value- and time-continuous emotion recognition has enormous potential benefits within healthcare. For example, within mental health, a real-time patient monitoring system capable of accurately inferring a patient's emotional state could help doctors make an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. Such interventions could be vital in terms of ensuring a higher quality of life for the patient involved. To make such tools a reality, the associated machine learning systems need to be fast, robust and generalisable. In this regard, we present herein, a novel emotion recognition system consisting of the shallowest realisable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. We draw insights from visualisations of the trained filter weights and the facial action unit (FAU) activations, i. e. the inputs to the model, of the participants featured in the in-the-wild, spontaneous video-chat sessions of the SEWA corpus. Further, we demonstrate the generalisablity of this approach on the German, Hungarian, and Chinese cultures available in this corpus. The obtained cross-cultural performance is a testimony to the universality of FAUs in expression and understanding of the human affective behaviours. These learnings were moderately consistent with the human perception of emotional expression. The practicality of the proposed approach is also demonstrated in another key healthcare applications; pain intensity prediction. Key results from these experiments highlight the transparency of the shallow CNN structure. As FAU can be extracted in near real-time, and because the models we developed are exceptionally shallow, this study paves the way for a robust, cross-cultural, end-to-end, in-the-wild, explainable real-time affect and pain prediction, that is value- and time-continuous.",

        "Abstract": "Detecting anomalies in process runtime behavior is crucial: they might reflect, on the one side, security breaches and fraudulent behavior and on the other side desired deviations due to, for example, exceptional conditions. Both scenarios yield valuable insights for process analysts and owners, but happen due to different reasons and require a different treatment. Hence a distinction into malign and benign anomalies is required. Existing anomaly detection approaches typically fall short in supporting experts when in need to take this decision. An additional problem are false positives which could result in selecting incorrect countermeasures. This paper proposes a novel anomaly detection approach based on association rule mining. It fosters the explanation of anomalies and the estimation of their severity. In addition, the approach is able to deal with process change and flexible executions which potentially lead to false positives. This facilitates to take the appropriate countermeasure for a malign anomaly and to avoid the possible termination of benign process executions. The feasibility and result quality of the approach are shown by a prototypical implementation and by analyzing real life logs with injected artificial anomalies. The explanatory power of the presented approach is evaluated through a controlled experiment with users. \u2022 Visualization concepts for rule violations, anomalies, and root causes are presented. \u2022 A comparison with five alternative anomaly detection approaches is given. \u2022 Related design requirements are discussed based on systematic literature reviews. \u2022 A user study on process anomaly root cause visualization techniques is performed. \u2022 Related challenges and limitations are discussed.",

The underlying theoretical basis is a framework for collaborative knowledge building with wikis that describes knowledge building as a co-evolution of individual and collective knowledge. These co-evolutionary processes may be visualized graphically, applying methods from social network analysis, especially those methods that take dynamic changes into account. For this purpose, we have undertaken to analyse, on the one hand, the temporal development of a Wikipedia article and related articles that are linked to this core article. On the other hand, we analysed the temporal development of those users who worked on these articles. The resulting graphics show an analogous process, both with regard to the articles that refer to the core article and to the users involved. These results provide empirical support for the co-evolution model.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "With the increased utilization of cognitive models for designing user interfaces several disciplines started to contribute to acquiring and representing knowledge about users, artifacts, and tasks. Although a wealth of studies already exists on modeling mental processes, and although the goals of cognitive engineering have become quite clear over the last decade, essential epistemological and methodological issues in the context of developing user interfaces have remained untouched. However, recent challenging tasks, namely designing information spaces for distributed user communities, have led to a revival of well known problems concerning the representation of knowledge and related issues, such as abstraction, navigation through information spaces, and visualization of abstract knowledge. All of these issues are associated with mental processes and thus, might become part of cognitive models. In this paper we reveal epistemological and methodological assumptions in the field of cognitive modeling as well as their implications for user interface design. It turns out that in order to achieve the goal of developing human-oriented (in contrast to technology-driven) human-computer interfaces developers have to develop knowledge of the structure and the representational dynamics of the cognitive systems which are interacting with the computer. We show that in a first step it is necessary to study and investigate the different levels and forms of representation that are involved in the interaction processes between computers and human cognitive systems. We propose a hybrid user modeling approach as part of the task-based development procedure in TADEUS (Task Analysis/Design/End User Systems). The hybrid approach does not only enable the representation of functional roles end users have to perform, but also how end users perform these roles, i.e. the representation and reflection, if not prediction of their behavior. This way, holistic system development that equally takes into account the organizational requirements and the end user reality at work places is facilitated.",

There is a need for simple and easy-to-implement interventions that are based on patients' perspectives, beliefs, and perceptions of their illness and medication. Objective: The objective is to test the effectivity of this intervention to improve medication adherence in patients with established cardiovascular disease, that is, in secondary prevention. Methods: In this study the effect of a personalized visualization of cardiovascular risk levels through a website aiming at supporting self management in combination with a group consultation and communication intervention by a nurse on adherence to treatment in 600 patients with manifest cardiovascular diseases will be assessed. The health belief model was chosen as main theoretical model for the intervention. Results: Primary outcome is adherence to treatment calculated by refill data. Secondary outcomes include the Beliefs about Medication Questionnaire and the Modified Morisky Scale. Patients are followed for one year. Results are expected by 2015. Conclusions: This study assesses adherence to treatment in a high-risk cardiovascular population by applying an intervention that addresses patients' capacity and practical barriers as well as patients' beliefs and perceptions of their illness and medication.",

A hypothesis is set that the 3D materials are better than the 2D materials for learning and memory recall. To test the hypothesis, we proposed a classification system that will predict true or false recall for short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) after learning by either 2D or 3D educational contents. For this purpose, EEG brain signals are recorded during learning and testing; the signals are then analysed in the time domain using different types of features in various frequency bands. The features are then fed into a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier. The experimental results indicate that the learning and memory recall using 2D and 3D contents do not have significant differences for both the STM and the LTM.",

The advantages of the method are that it (a) reduces evaluation complexity by transforming claim-to-claim comparisons into claim-to-criteria comparisons, and (b) provides a means of comparing judgment standards between different legal authorities in mechanical engineering terms. Reliability and validity of the method are tested through focus groups using a case study on aircraft seats. The scope of the method is limited to the field of mechanical inventions.",

Augmented reality offers a novel method to seamlessly combine real information with virtual objects created by computed tomographic angiography to help the surgeon \"see through\" the skin and precisely localize the perforator. The head-mounted display augmented reality system HoloLens (Microsoft) could facilitate augmented reality-based perforator localization for a more convenient and safe procedure.<bold>Objective: </bold>The aim of this study was to evaluate the precision of the HoloLens-based vascular localization system, as the most important performance indicator of a new localization system.<bold>Methods: </bold>The precision of the HoloLens-based vascular localization system was tested in a simulated operating room under different conditions with a three-dimensional (3D) printed model. The coordinates of five pairs of points on the vascular map that could be easily identified on the 3D printed model and virtual model were detected by a probe, and the distance between the corresponding points was calculated as the navigation error.<bold>Results: </bold>The mean errors were determined under different conditions, with a minimum error of 1.35 mm (SD 0.43) and maximum error of 3.18 mm (SD 1.32), which were within the clinically acceptable range. There were no significant differences in the errors obtained under different visual angles, different light intensities, or different states (static or motion). However, the error was larger when tested with light compared with that tested without light.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This precision evaluation demonstrated that the HoloLens system can precisely localize the perforator and potentially help the surgeon accomplish the operation.

        "Abstract": "We conducted an experiment with a posttest, between-subjects design to evaluate the potential of emerging 3D telepresence technology to support collaboration in emergency health care. 3D telepresence technology has the potential to provide richer visual information than do current 2D video conferencing techniques. This may be of benefit in diagnosing and treating patients in emergency situations where specialized medical expertise is not locally available. The experimental design and results concerning information behavior are presented in the article \u201cExploring the Potential of Video Technologies for Collaboration in Emergency Medical Care: Part I. Information Sharing\u201d (Sonnenwald et al., this issue). In this article, we explore paramedics' task performance during the experiment as they diagnosed and treated a trauma victim while working alone or in collaboration with a physician via 2D videoconferencing or via a 3D proxy. Analysis of paramedics' task performance shows that paramedics working with a physician via a 3D proxy performed the fewest harmful interventions and showed the least variation in task performance time. Paramedics in the 3D proxy condition also reported the highest levels of self-efficacy. Interview data confirm these statistical results. Overall, the results indicate that 3D telepresence technology has the potential to improve paramedics' performance of complex medical tasks and improve emergency trauma health care if designed and implemented appropriately.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Lifespace is a multidimensional construct that describes the geographic area in which a person lives and conducts their activities, and reflects mobility, health, and well-being. Traditionally, it has been measured by asking older people to self-report the length and frequency of trips taken and assistance required. Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors on smartphones have been used to measure Lifespace of older people, but not with people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate whether GPS data collected via smartphones could be used to indicate the Lifespace of people with PD. Methods: The dataset was supplied via the Michael J Fox Foundation Data Challenge and included 9 people with PD and 7 approximately matched controls. Participants carried smartphones with GPS sensors over two months. Data analysis compared the PD group and the control group. The impact of symptom severity on Lifespace was also investigated. Results: Visualization methods for comparing Lifespace were developed including scatterplots and heatmaps. Lifespace metrics for comparison included average daily distance, percentage of time spent at home, and number of trips into the community. There were no significant differences between the PD and the control groups on Lifespace metrics. Visual representations of Lifespace were organized based on the self-reported severity of symptoms, suggesting a trend of decreasing Lifespace with increasing PD symptoms. Conclusions: Lifespace measured by GPS-enabled smartphones may be a useful concept to measure the progression of PD and the impact of various therapies and rehabilitation programs. Directions for future use of GPS-based Lifespace are provided.",

In order to foster students' spatial abilities, the program provided specific functions included partition, complementation, recombination, and multi-perspective to promote their \"mental image\" as well as \"visualization.\" The proposed program was evaluated with the quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test control group design to probe into students' learning performance. Moreover, students' error types of problem-solving were analyzed using their solving track recorded in the sheets. The results showed that the MAR remedial teaching program truly benefit students on solving geometry problems regarding compound-cube-surface area, and there are still some questions needed to investigate in the future, such as how students were affected by visual-obscuration to inexactly carry out their counts.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Citation analysis has become an essential tool for research and academic effectiveness evaluation of universities. However, authorship identity has long been difficult to resolve in bibliometric analyses for many scientific fields, where performance of algorithms against human judgment is far from universal. Now with the boom of authors with compound names (mainly, Latino researchers and from Portuguese language countries) in scientific publications, clustering methods continue lowering their performance, due to completely forgetting the context and order of names (first name's' and last name's') of each author in the publication (authorship identity). These kinds of mistakes affect visualization of publications, decreasing the likelihood of finding a given article by a specific author and generating bad quotations in the online systems. This has led to an unsuitable registration and unsuitable grouping of author names 'ambiguous authorship identity' of each scientific publication. This process requires more work, time, attention, and accountability on the part of authors, reviewers, journal editors, and providers of bibliographic databases. These errors can be corrected by cross-referencing with each full original article, using manual checks and without ignoring the names issue at the moment of drafting and/or reviewing a manuscript. This paper seeks to raise awareness on how to write author names, highlighting the way in which they are being cited and self-citing the name of authors and co-authors in the publications.",

We introduce from the ground up a formal theory of 8 plus 3 structural patterns for XML elements, and verify their identifiability in a number of different XML vocabularies. The results allowed the creation of visualization and content extraction tools that are completely independent of the schema and without any previous knowledge of the semantics and organization of the XML vocabulary of the documents.",

        "Abstract": "Translational medical research literatures have increased rapidly in last decades and there have been fewer attempts or efforts to map global research context of translational medical related research. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the global progress and to assess the current quantitatively trends on translational medical research by using a scientometric approach to survey translational medicine related literatures in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E), Social Science Citation Index and PubMed database from 1992 to 2012. The scientometric methods and knowledge visualization technologies were employed in this paper. The document types, languages, publication patterns, subject categories, journals, geographic and institutional distributions, top cited papers, and the distribution of keywords as well as MeSH terms were thoroughly examined. Translational medicine research has increased rapidly over past 20 years, most notably in the last 4 years. In total, there are currently 3,627 research articles in 1,062 journals listed in 91 SCI-E subject categories. The top 20 productive countries and institutes were analyzed herein, where 11 key papers in translational medical research and research foci were identified. Research outputs descriptors have suggested that the presence of a solid development in translational medical research, where research in this field has mainly focused on experimental medicine, general internal medicine, and medical laboratory technologies. All these outcomes have been concentrated in several journals such as Translational Research, Translational Oncology, Translational Stroke Research, and Translational Neuroscience. G7 countries make up the leading nations for translational medical research, where the center is located in USA. American institutions have made great advances in paper productions, citations, and cooperation, with overall great strengths and good development prospects. Moreover, the evolution pathway of translational medical research has been summarized as bellows: problems emerged, causes analyzed, challenges faced and solutions proposed, translational medical research programs been formally established, theoretical and applied research, all of which was in full swing. During this process, neoplasms and genomics, interdisciplinary communication between academic medical centers/institutes, drug design and development, cardiovascular and brain diseases, and even biomedical research have been identified as mainstream topics in translational medical research fields.",

The U. S. has 11 federal agencies dedicated to supporting programs and providing funding for research and curriculum development. The domain of STEM education has significant implications in preparing the desired workforce with the requisite knowledge, developing appropriate curricula, providing teachers the necessary professional development, focusing research dollars on areas that have maximum impact, and developing national educational policy and standards. A complex undertaking such as STEM education, which attracts interest and valuable resources from a number of stakeholders needs to be well understood. In light of this, we attempt to describe the underlying structure of STEM education, its core areas, and their relationships through co-word analyses of the titles, keywords, and abstracts of the relevant literature using visualization and bibliometric mapping tools.

This paper discusses the design of the application and the interaction techniques used to obtain information. We also present the results of a formal evaluation. Although no statistically significant differences were found, results indicate that students who used the virtual environment had higher test scores than those who only attended a lecture on the material. Trends suggest that the virtual experience allowed students to learn information directly and also equipped them to better learn and understand material from a traditional lecture.",

We sought to understand the broad range of social and technical factors that affect test result management in an integrated EHR-based health system. Methods Between June and November 2010, we conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey of all primary care practitioners (PCPs) within the Department of Veterans Affairs nationwide. Survey development was guided by a socio-technical model describing multiple inter-related dimensions of EHR use. Findings Of 5001 PCPs invited, 2590 (51.8%) responded. 55.5% believed that the EHRs did not have convenient features for notifying patients of test results. Over a third (37.9%) reported having staff support needed for notifying patients of test results. Many relied on the patient's next visit to notify them for normal (46.1%) and abnormal results (20.1%). Only 45.7% reported receiving adequate training on using the EHR notification system and 35.1% reported having an assigned contact for technical assistance with the EHR; most received help from colleagues (60.4%). A majority (85.6%) stayed after hours or came in on weekends to address notifications; less than a third reported receiving protected time (30.1%). PCPs strongly endorsed several new features to improve test result management, including better tracking and visualization of result notifications. Conclusions Despite an advanced EHR, both social and technical challenges exist in ensuring notification of test results to practitioners and patients. Current EHR technology requires significant improvement in order to avoid similar challenges elsewhere.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Background: Recent advances in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke have made rapid acquisition, visualization, and interpretation of images a key factor for positive patient outcomes. We have developed a new teleradiology system based on a client-server architecture that enables rapid access to interactive advanced 2-D and 3-D visualization on a current generation smartphone device (Apple iPhone or iPod Touch, or an Android phone) without requiring patient image data to be stored on the device. Instead, a server loads and renders the patient images, then transmits a rendered frame to the remote device. Objective: Our objective was to determine if a new smartphone client-server teleradiology system is capable of providing accuracies and interpretation times sufficient for diagnosis of acute stroke. Methods: This was a retrospective study. We obtained 120 recent consecutive noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) brain scans and 70 computed tomography angiogram (CTA) head scans from the Calgary Stroke Program database. Scans were read by two neuroradiologists, one on a medical diagnostic workstation and an iPod or iPhone (hereafter referred to as an iOS device) and the other only on an iOS device. NCCT brain scans were evaluated for early signs of infarction, which includes early parenchymal ischemic changes and dense vessel sign, and to exclude acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage and stroke mimics. CTA brain scans were evaluated for any intracranial vessel occlusion. The interpretations made on an iOS device were compared with those made at a workstation. The total interpretation times were recorded for both platforms. Interrater agreement was assessed. True positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives were obtained, and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of detecting the abnormalities on the iOS device were computed. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of detecting intraparenchymal hemorrhage were 100% using the iOS device with a perfect interrater agreement (kappa = 1). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of detecting acute parenchymal ischemic change were 94.1%, 100%, and 98.09% respectively for reader 1 and 97.05%, 100%, and 99.04% for reader 2 with nearly perfect interrater agreement (kappa = .8). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of detecting dense vessel sign were 100%, 95.4%, and 96.19% respectively for reader 1 and 72.2%, 100%, and 95.23% for reader 2 using the iOS device with a good interrater agreement (kappa = .69). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of detecting vessel occlusion on CT angiography scans were 94.4%, 100%, and 98.46% respectively for both readers using the iOS device, with perfect interrater agreement (kappa = 1). No significant difference (P < .05) was noted in the interpretation time between the workstation and iOS device. Conclusion: The smartphone client-server teleradiology system appears promising and may have the potential to allow urgent management decisions in acute stroke. However, this study was retrospective, involved relatively few patient studies, and only two readers. Generalizing conclusions about its clinical utility, especially in other diagnostic use cases, should not be made until additional studies are performed.",

Visualizations of the topics and the alignment between topics and communities are presented to support the interpretation of the results in context of public health communication and identification of communities at risk of rejecting the safety and efficacy of HPV vaccines.<bold>Results: </bold>We analyzed 285,417 Twitter posts (tweets) about HPV vaccines from 101,519 users connected by 4,387,524 social connections. Examining the alignment between the community structure and the topics of tweets, the results indicated that the Louvain community detection algorithm together with DMM produced consistently higher alignment values and that alignments were generally higher when the number of topics was lower. After applying the Louvain method and DMM with 30 topics and grouping semantically similar topics in a hierarchy, we characterized 163,148 (57.16%) tweets as evidence and advocacy, and 6244 (2.19%) tweets describing personal experiences. Among the 4548 users who posted experiential tweets, 3449 users (75.84%) were found in communities where the majority of tweets were about evidence and advocacy.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The use of community detection in concert with topic modeling appears to be a useful way to characterize Twitter communities for the purpose of opinion surveillance in public health applications. Our approach may help identify online communities at risk of being influenced by negative opinions about public health interventions such as HPV vaccines.",

The performance of this method has been proved to be very good. It can solve problems on keywords and indexes used in co-word analysis effectively and can improve the veracity of co-word analysis. Using this method, the research filed of 'human intelligence network' in China has been analyzed. According to the analysis result, we point out that there are four research focuses on it in China now.

        "Abstract": "Background: MEDLINE\u00ae/PubMed\u00ae indexes over 20 million biomedical articles, providing curated annotation of its contents using a controlled vocabulary known as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The MeSH vocabulary, developed over 50+ years, provides a broad coverage of topics across biomedical research. Distilling the essential biomedical themes for a topic of interest from the relevant literature is important to both understand the importance of related concepts and discover new relationships. Results: We introduce a novel method for determining enriched curator-assigned MeSH annotations in a set of papers associated to a topic, such as a gene, an author or a disease. We generate MeSH Over-representation Profiles (MeSHOPs) to quantitatively summarize the annotations in a form convenient for further computational analysis and visualization. Based on a hypergeometric distribution of assigned terms, MeSHOPs statistically account for the prevalence of the associated biomedical annotation while highlighting unusually prevalent terms based on a specified background. MeSHOPs can be visualized using word clouds, providing a succinct quantitative graphical representation of the relative importance of terms. Using the publication dates of articles, MeSHOPs track changing patterns of annotation over time. Since MeSHOPs are quantitative vectors, MeSHOPs can be compared using standard techniques such as hierarchical clustering. The reliability of MeSHOP annotations is assessed based on the capacity to re-derive the subset of the Gene Ontology annotations with equivalent MeSH terms. Conclusions: MeSHOPs allows quantitative measurement of the degree of association between any entity and the annotated medical concepts, based directly on relevant primary literature. Comparison of MeSHOPs allows entities to be related based on shared medical themes in their literature. A web interface is provided for generating and visualizing MeSHOPs.",

        "Abstract": "Information on the creation of a painting lies usually hidden under the surface. A painting's substructure may include the underdrawing, underpainting, modifications to the initial setup (or pentimenti), and sometimes even abandoned compositions. Traditionally, the study of these characteristics relies on penetrative, two-dimensional imaging techniques (infrared reflectography, x-ray radiography) complemented with selected paint cross sections. The limitations of this approach are twofold. First, it can be difficult to combine data from cross sections with two-dimensional images, because of poor redundancy of both methods. Second, cross sections involve destructive sampling of the paint layer. This paper introduces synchrotron radiation computed micro-laminography in the study of paintings. The technique allows for three-dimensional imaging of the paint stratigraphy in a nondestructive manner, enabling the imaging of paint layers, their interfaces, the ground, and carrier. The technique is demonstrated on a test painting, and its interest to curators and conservators of painting collections is discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Older adults' health maintenance may be enhanced by having access to online health information. However, usability issues may prevent older adults from easily accessing such information. Prior research has shown that aging is associated with a unique pattern of cognitive changes, and knowledge of these changes may be used in the design of health websites for older adults. Objective: The goal of the current study was to examine whether older adults use of a health information website was affected by an alternative information architecture and access interface (hierarchical versus tag-based). Methods: Fifty younger adults (aged 18-23) and 50 older adults (aged 60-80) navigated a health information website, which was organized hierarchically or used tags/keywords, to find answers to health-related questions while their performance was tracked. We hypothesized that older adults would perform better in the tag-based health information website because it placed greater demands on abilities that remain intact with aging (verbal ability and vocabulary). Results: The pattern of age-related differences in computer use was consistent with prior research with older adults. We found that older adults had been using computers for less time (F[sub 1,98] = 10.6, P= .002) and used them less often (F[sub 1,98] = 11.3, P= .001) than younger adults. Also consistent with the cognitive aging literature, younger adults had greater spatial visualization and orientation abilities (F[sub 1,98] = 34.6, P< .001 and F[sub 1,98] = 6.8, P= .01) and a larger memory span (F[sub 1,98] = 5.7, P= .02) than older adults, but older adults had greater vocabulary (F[sub 1,98] = 11.4, P= .001). Older adults also took significantly more medications than younger adults (F[sub 1,98] = 57.7, P< .001). In the information search task, older adults performed worse than younger adults (F[sub 1,96] = 18.0, P < .001). However, there was a significant age x condition interaction indicating that while younger adults outperformed older adults in the hierarchical condition (F[sub 1,96] = 25.2, P< .001), there were no significant age-related differences in the tag-based condition, indicating that older adults performed as well as younger adults in this condition. Conclusions: Access to online health information is increasing in popularity and can lead to a more informed health consumer. However, usability barriers may differentially affect older adults. The results of the current study suggest that the design of health information websites that take into account age-related changes in cognition can enhance older adults' access to such information.",

This article argues that archival theory, when combined with histori- ography and technical or computational standards, contributes to a new theory called digital historiography. Digital historiography is defined as the interdisciplinary study of the interaction of digital technology with historical practice. Three archival processes-selection, search, and the application of metadata-form the theory's foundation for determining a digital historical representation's contextualization, which may aid in assessing its trustwor- thiness and effectiveness to communicate historical knowledge.",

Specifically, it develops a network-based mapping technique and a user-focused Hirsch index (user-side h-index) given the lack of previous studies on collection evaluation methods that have used the h-index. A user-side h-index is developed and compared with previous indices (use factor, difference of percentages, collection-side h-index) that represent the strengths of the subject classes of a library collection. The mapping procedure includes the subject-usage profiling of 63 subject classes and collection-usage map generations through the pathfinder network algorithm. Cluster analyses are then conducted upon the pathfinder network to generate 5 large and 14 small clusters. The nodes represent the strengths of the subject-class usages reflected by the user-side h-index. The user-side h-index was found to have advantages (e.g., better demonstrating the real utility of each subject class) over the other indices. It also can more clearly distinguish the strengths between the subject classes than can collection-side h-index. These results may help to identify actual usage and strengths of subject classes in library collections through visualized maps. This may be a useful rationale for the establishment of the collection-development plan.",

A core deliverable of the project's first phase was OCLC's development of the Web Archives Workbench (WAW), an open-source suite of Web archiving tools for identifying, describing, and harvesting Web-based content for ingestion into an external digital repository. Released in October 2007, the suite is designed to bridge the gap between manual selection and automated capture based on the \"Arizona Model,\" which applies a traditional aggregate-based archival approach to Web archiving. Aggregate-based archiving refers to archiving items by group or in series, rather than individually. Core functionality of the suite includes the ability to identify Web content of potential interest through crawls of \"seed\" URLs and the domains they link to; tools for creating and managing metadata for association with harvested objects; website structural analysis and visualization to aid human content selection decisions; and packaging using a PREMIS-based METS profile developed by the ECHO DEPository to support easier ingestion into multiple repositories. This article provides background on the Arizona Model; an overview of how the tools work and their technical implementation; and a brief summary of user feedback from testing and implementing the tools.",

They utilize publication records of more than 200,000 scholarly journal articles, together with affiliations of the authors to infer distance collaborations. The longevity of their study is of interest because it covers several years before and after the birth of the Internet and computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) technologies. Thus, they provide one lens through which the impact of computer-assisted collaborative work technologies can be viewed. Their results show that there has been a steady and constant growth in the frequency of both interinstitute and cross-country collaborations in a particular physics domain, regardless of the introduction of these technologies. This suggests that we are witnessing an evolution, rather than a revolution, with respect to long-distance collaborative behavior. An interdisciplinary approach, combining numerical statistics, graph visualizations, and social network measurements, facilitates their remarks on the changes in the size and structure of these collaborations over this period of history.",

Deteriorated acetatebased safety negatives are complex objects due to the separation and channeling of their multiple layers that has often occurred over 70 years time. Using single-scatter diffuse transmission model, the intrinsic intensity information and shape distortion of film can be modeled. A combination of structured-light and high-dynamic range imaging is used to acquire the data which allows for automatic photometric and geometric correction of the negatives. This is done with a simple-to-deploy and cost-effective camera and LCD system that are already available to most libraries and museums. An initial analysis is provided to show the accuracy of this method and promising results of restoration of actual negatives from a special archive collection are then produced.",

The study is based on a corpus of English-language articles published between 1996 and 2003. This corpus was first searched for illustrations on marketing as well as mergers and acquisitions, and categorized into different types of visual metaphor. The visualizations of metaphor were subsequently compared to verbal metaphoric expressions in the same discourse domain to check for qualitative and quantitative congruence between the verbal and visual modes. Illustrations in business magazines employ the same metaphors as do verbal texts. Moreover, the frequency patterns ascertained for verbal metaphors are largely maintained in visual representation, with war/fighting being most dominant. Alternative metaphors are marginal in both modes. In terms of classification, the study shows that the majority of visual metaphoric expressions integrate the source and the target domain into a single gestalt. These results indicate that the visual design of business magazines support the verbal metaphors, thus producing the dominant models underlying business-media discourse.",

The second was a service based on an office filing system metaphor, with different metaphor-related menu options at each level. User performance and attitudes to the services were recorded over a six week period, and post-trial interviews conducted. Results showed that the interface metaphor improved participants' performance compared to the standard service, but had no effect on attitudes. Context of use did not affect the usability of the services, which supports their use for mobile interaction. Visualisation of the metaphor-based service significantly affected participants' attitudes, suggesting an additional benefit of using interface metaphor for the design of speech-based mobile phone services.",

To date, sign language recognition research has mostly ignored facial expressions that arise as part of a natural sign language discourse, even though they carry important grammatical and prosodic information. One reason is that tracking the motion and dynamics of expressions in human faces from video is a hard task, especially with the high number of occlusions from the signers\u2019 hands. This paper presents a 3D deformable model tracking system to address this problem, and applies it to sequences of native signers, taken from the National Center of Sign Language and Gesture Resources (NCSLGR), with a special emphasis on outlier rejection methods to handle occlusions. The experiments conducted in this paper validate the output of the face tracker against expert human annotations of the NCSLGR corpus, demonstrate the promise of the proposed face tracking framework for sign language data, and reveal that the tracking framework picks up properties that ideally complement human annotations for linguistic research.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Knowledge Translation (KT) plays a vital role in the modern health care community, facilitating the incorporation of new evidence into practice. Web 2.0 tools provide a useful mechanism for establishing an online KT environment in which health practitioners share their practice-related knowledge and experiences with an online community of practice. We have implemented a Web 2.0 based KT environment--an online discussion forum--for pediatric pain practitioners across seven different hospitals in Thailand. The online discussion forum enabled the pediatric pain practitioners to share and translate their experiential knowledge to help improve the management of pediatric pain in hospitals. Objective: The goal of this research is to investigate the knowledge sharing dynamics of a community of practice through an online discussion forum. We evaluated the communication patterns of the community members using statistical and social network analysis methods in order to better understand how the online community engages to share experiential knowledge. Methods: Statistical analyses and visualizations provide a broad overview of the communication patterns within the discussion forum. Social network analysis provides the tools to delve deeper into the social network, identifying the most active members of the community, reporting the overall health of the social network, isolating the potential core members of the social network, and exploring the inter-group relationships that exist across institutions and professions. Results: The statistical analyses revealed a network dominated by a single institution and a single profession, and found a varied relationship between reading and posting content to the discussion forum. The social network analysis discovered a healthy network with strong communication patterns, while identifying which users are at the center of the community in terms of facilitating communication. The group-level analysis suggests that there is strong interprofessional and interregional communication, but a dearth of non-nurse participants has been identified as a shortcoming. Conclusions: The results of the analysis suggest that the discussion forum is active and healthy, and that, though few, the interprofessional and interinstitutional ties are strong.",

        "Abstract": "Research on elderly people's ICT acceptance and use often relies on the technology acceptance model (TAM) framework, but has been mostly limited to task-oriented uses. This article expands approaches in technology acceptance and use by developing a model to explain entertainment-related uses of new media technology by elderly people. On a theoretical level, we expand the TAM perspective by adding concepts that act as barriers and/or facilitators of technology acceptance, namely technophobia, self-efficacy and previous experience and expertise with technology. We develop an expanded TAM by testing the role of these concepts in two studies on entertainment media technology. In Study 1, we investigate behavioural intention to use 3D cinema amongN\u2009=\u2009125 German elderly media users (Age 50+). In Study 2, we focus the actual use of a computer game simulation byN\u2009=\u2009115 German and US elderly media users (Age 50+). Findings in both studies point towards the central role of perceived usefulness, here modelled as enjoyment, as the reason for elderly people's use and acceptance of entertainment media technology. Perceived ease of use is seen as a precondition for enjoyment, particularly for interactive media.",

Every week, new applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence are added to a growing corpus of work. Random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks are now having a genuine impact for applications as diverse as discovering extrasolar planets, transient objects, quasars, and gravitationally lensed systems, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. This review surveys contemporary, published literature on machine learning and artificial intelligence in astronomy and astrophysics. Applications span seven main categories of activity: classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights. These categories form the basis of a hierarchy of maturity, as the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence emerges, progresses, or becomes established.

Requirements for more rigorous and general matching procedures are presented. A solution to one key requirement is presented: a new report structure for usability problems.It is designed to improve the quality of matches made between usability problems found during empirical user testing and problems predicted by analytic methods.

        "Abstract": "Background and objectives Advances in MRI hardware and sequences are continually increasing the amount and complexity of data such as those generated in high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) scanning of the spine. Efficient informatics tools offer considerable opportunities for research and clinically based analyses of magnetic resonance studies. In this work, we present and validate a suite of informatics tools for automated detection of degenerative changes in lumbar intervertebral discs (IVD) from both 3D isotropic and routine two-dimensional (2D) clinical T2-weighted MRI. Materials and methods An automated segmentation approach was used to extract morphological (traditional 2D radiological measures and novel 3D shape descriptors) and signal appearance (extracted from signal intensity histograms) features. The features were validated against manual reference, compared between 2D and 3D MRI scans and used for quantification and classification of IVD degeneration across magnetic resonance datasets containing IVD with early and advanced stages of degeneration. Results and conclusions Combination of the novel 3D-based shape and signal intensity features on 3D (area under receiver operating curve (AUC) 0.984) and 2D (AUC 0.988) magnetic resonance data deliver a significant improvement in automated classification of IVD degeneration, compared to the combination of previously used 2D radiological measurement and signal intensity features (AUC 0.976 and 0.983, respectively). Further work is required regarding the usefulness of 2D and 3D shape data in relation to clinical scores of lower back pain. The results reveal the potential of the proposed informatics system for computer-aided IVD diagnosis from MRI in large-scale research studies and as a possible adjunct for clinical diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "The United States federal government is in the midst of an e- government revolution characterized by a shift from paper-based citizen-government interactions to electronic-based interactions. Driven by the demands of citizens and supported by the President and Congress, federal departments are redesigning the look and feel of their Internet presences, moving away from traditional bureaucracy- centred presentation of information to more usable citizen-centred presentations. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the USA's principal federal agency tasked with protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, has undertaken a massive reorganization of its e-health enterprise. The most publicly visible component of this reorganization is the hhs.gov portal website. This desperately needed portal - usability testing indicated that more than 60 per cent of visitors to the Department's original website failed to find the information they sought - provides easy access to the wealth of HHS information and links its diverse operating agencies. The new HHS portal simplifies citizen access to the Department by: decompartmentalizing information by removing content from bureaucratic silos 2 and rearranging it in a natural navigation scheme; tuning content and navigation features to ensure that all users have access to information tailored for them; presenting content in appropriate and citizen-preferred formats; and complying with federal accessibility regulations for blind and vision-impaired users. This paper presents a series of lessons learned during the development of the HHS portal, and results of usability testing to determine what common design features present accessibility problems particular to the blind and vision-impaired communities. These discussions of practical avenues to improving the accessibility and usability of e-health websites through appropriate and effective information designs are followed by our thoughts on the future of Internet architectures and the limitations of 'layering' technologies when striving for universal accessibility.",

        "Abstract": "The recent proliferation of commercial three-dimensional digital scanning devices has made 3D scanning, and virtual and physical replication, a practical reality in the field of heritage preservation. 3D scanning produces a high-precision digital reference document that records condition, provides a virtual model for replication, and makes possible easy mass distribution of digital data. In addition to research, documentation, and replication, 3D data of artifacts are increasingly being used for museum collections storage and packing designs. The cost and complexity of 3D imaging technologies have made 3D scanning impractical for many heritage institutions in the past, but this is changing, as an increasing number of commercial systems are being tailored and marketed for heritage applications. This paper presents a review of the current state of 3D imaging in the cultural heritage field, methods of physical replication, the different systems used in heritage applications, criteria for choosing a system, and the techniques used for working with the data. Attention is given to identifying those objects that are not likely to be suited for 3D scanning.",

First, we analyze the affordances provided by the Instagram interface and the ways this interface and the application's tools structure users' understanding and use of the \"Instagram medium.\" Next, we compare the visual signatures of 13 different global cities using 2.3 million Instagram photos from these cities.

        "Abstract": "Background: Only 17% of Norwegian children and adolescents with diabetes achieve international treatment goals measured by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Classic patient-physician consultations seem to be poorly adapted to young children. New strategies that are better attuned to young people to improve support of adolescents' self-management of diabetes need to be tested and evaluated. Objective: (1) To explore how applications for mobile phones can be used in follow-up of adolescents with type 1 diabetes, and (2) to use the findings to guide further development of the applications and as a basis for future studies. Method: We pilot tested two mobile phone applications: (1) an application that contained a picture-based diabetes diary to record physical activity and photos taken with the phone camera of food eaten, where the phone also communicated with the glucometer by Bluetooth technology to capture blood glucose values, and (2) a Web-based, password-secured and encrypted short message service (SMS), based on access using login passwords received via SMS to be used by participants to send messages to their providers when they faced obstacles in everyday life, and to send educational messages to the participants. At the end of the 3-month pilot study, 12 participants (7 girls and 5 boys ) aged 13-19 years completed semistructured interviews. The participants had a mean HbA1c value of 8.3 (SD 0.3), mean age of 16.2 (SD 1.7) years, mean body mass index of 23.3 (SD 3.2) kg/m\u00b2, and mean diabetes duration of 7.5 (SD 4.6) years. We applied three additional measurements: change in metabolic control as measured by HbA1c, the System Usability Scale, and diabetes knowledge. Results: From the interviews, three main categories emerged: visualization, access, and software changes. Participants appreciated the picture-based diary more than the SMS solution. Visualization of cornerstones in diabetes self-care (ie, diet, insulin dosage, physical activity, and pre- and postprandial glucose measurements all transformed into one picture) in the mobile diary was found to be an important educational tool through reflections in action. This led to a change in participants' applied knowledge about the management of their disease. Additional measurements supplemented and supported the qualitative findings. However, changes in HbA1c and participants' theoretical knowledge as tested by a 27-item questionnaire, based on a national health informatics' diabetes quiz, before and after the intervention were not statistically significant (P = .38 and P = .82, respectively, paired-samples t test). Participants suggested additional functionality, and we will implement this in the design of the next software generation. Conclusion: Participants reported an increased understanding of applied knowledge, which seem to positively affect diabetes self-care. Visual impressions seem well adapted to the maturation of the adolescent brain, facilitating the link between theoretical knowledge and executive functions. SMS gave the adolescents a feeling of increased access and security. Participants gave valuable input for further development of these applications.",

Teachers and instructors have long been engaged in discussions to define effective curricula for teaching computer animation. Various multidisciplinary and collaborative methodologies have been proposed. This manuscript assesses both the impact of a collaborative teaching approach and the curriculum. Two equivalent learning paths are compared; both of them encompass courses of photography, storytelling and computer animation and require prerequisites in 3D modeling and rendering. The learning path of the \"Systemic Design\" degree is taught by the collaborative Open Space Technology (OST) approach, whereas the path of \"Cinema and Media Engineering\" is taught more conventionally (independent courses). The results clearly show how effective teaching methodologies cannot completely compensate for a nontechnical background; on the other hand, as expected, students appreciate and can take advantage of collaborative forms of teaching.",

To do so, we develop a research prototype for a collaborative virtual environment that utilises avatars to improve workspace awareness in collaborative tasks. We test this solution through two studies, qualitative and quantitative, in which participants have to collaborate to jointly validate and correct a diagrammatic model of operational procedures. Our evaluations provide both positive and negative results about the proposed prototype. Collaboration patterns changed and became significantly easier, but, task performance was only slightly improved. Together, these findings inform both the ongoing development of collaborative 3D virtual environments and the role of technology-mediated collaboration for validating and fixing models of processes.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Background: There is increasing recognition that supermarkets are an important environment for health-promoting interventions such as fiscal food policies or front-of-pack nutrition labeling. However, due to the complexities of undertaking such research in the real world, well-designed randomized controlled trials on these kinds of interventions are lacking. The Virtual Supermarket is a 3-dimensional computerized research environment designed to enable experimental studies in a supermarket setting without the complexity or costs normally associated with undertaking such research. Objective: The primary objective was to validate the Virtual Supermarket by comparing virtual and real-life food purchasing behavior. A secondary objective was to obtain participant feedback on perceived sense of \"presence\" (the subjective experience of being in one place or environment even if physically located in another) in the Virtual Supermarket. Methods: Eligible main household shoppers (New Zealand adults aged \u226518 years) were asked to conduct 3 shopping occasions in the Virtual Supermarket over 3 consecutive weeks, complete the validated Presence Questionnaire Items Stems, and collect their real supermarket grocery till receipts for that same period. Proportional expenditure (NZ$) and the proportion of products purchased over 18 major food groups were compared between the virtual and real supermarkets. Data were analyzed using repeated measures mixed models. Results: A total of 123 participants consented to take part in the study. In total, 69.9% (86/123) completed 1 shop in the Virtual Supermarket, 64.2% (79/123) completed 2 shops, 60.2% (74/123) completed 3 shops, and 48.8% (60/123) returned their real supermarket till receipts. The 4 food groups with the highest relative expenditures were the same for the virtual and real supermarkets: fresh fruit and vegetables (virtual estimate: 14.3%; real: 17.4%), bread and bakery (virtual: 10.0%; real: 8.2%), dairy (virtual: 19.1%; real: 12.6%), and meat and fish (virtual: 16.5%; real: 16.8%). Significant differences in proportional expenditures were observed for 6 food groups, with largest differences (virtual - real) for dairy (in expenditure 6.5%, P<.001; in items 2.2%, P=.04) and fresh fruit and vegetables (in expenditure: -3.1%, P=.04; in items: 5.9%, P=.002). There was no trend of overspending in the Virtual Supermarket and participants experienced a medium-to-high presence (88%, 73/83 scored medium; 8%, 7/83 scored high). Conclusions: Shopping patterns in the Virtual Supermarket were comparable to those in real life. Overall, the Virtual Supermarket is a valid tool to measure food purchasing behavior. Nevertheless, it is important to improve the functionality of some food categories, in particular fruit and vegetables and dairy. The results of this validation will assist in making further improvements to the software and with optimization of the internal and external validity of this innovative methodology.",

        "Type": "Academic Journal",
        "Sub_Type": "Article",
        "Abstract": "Background: Immersive patient simulators (IPSs) combine the simulation of virtual patients with a three-dimensional (3D) environment and, thus, allow an illusionary immersion into a synthetic world, similar to computer games. Playful learning in a 3D environment is motivating and allows repetitive training and internalization of medical workflows (ie, procedural knowledge) without compromising real patients. The impact of this innovative educational concept on learning success requires review of feasibility and validity. Objective: It was the aim of this paper to conduct a survey of all immersive patient simulators currently available. In addition, we address the question of whether the use of these simulators has an impact on knowledge gain by summarizing the existing validation studies. Methods: A systematic literature search via PubMed was performed using predefined inclusion criteria (ie, virtual worlds, focus on education of medical students, validation testing) to identify all available simulators. Validation testing was defined as the primary end point. Results: There are currently 13 immersive patient simulators available. Of these, 9 are Web-based simulators and represent feasibility studies. None of these simulators are used routinely for student education. The workstation-based simulators are commercially driven and show a higher quality in terms of graphical quality and/or data content. Out of the studies, 1 showed a positive correlation between simulated content and real content (ie, content validity). There was a positive correlation between the outcome of simulator training and alternative training methods (ie, concordance validity), and a positive coherence between measured outcome and future professional attitude and performance (ie, predictive validity). Conclusions: IPSs can promote learning and consolidation of procedural knowledge. The use of immersive patient simulators is still marginal, and technical and educational approaches are heterogeneous. Academic-driven IPSs could possibly enhance the content quality, improve the validity level, and make this educational concept accessible to all medical students.",

        "Abstract": "This paper illustrates the use of three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning to produce virtual models from plaster piece molds of the Richard-Ginori porcelain factory (Sesto Fiorentino, Italy). This study was carried out as part of a long-term project to document the artifacts of the factory including porcelain sculpture, models in wax, terracotta, and plaster, as well a collection of several thousand plaster piece molds dating from the mid-18th to the early 20th century. The objects contained inside the molds are often not recognizable as the molds are made up of several pieces and the internal surfaces are, of course, in negative. Previously, the identification of the molds' subject matter has been limited to recasting porcelain models to produce positives. This time-consuming process can compromise the preservation of the molds. Virtual reconstruction using 3D laser scanning was applied to a set of plaster molds for a statuette called the Giant. Comparison of the virtual reproduction to the original model in terracotta demonstrated it was a faithful copy. The method described in this paper proves that identification of the subject and preservation of the molds are possible with numerous benefits over the traditional process for producing finished porcelain artifacts.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: Recent advances in 3D modeling provide us with real 3D datasets to answer queries, such as \u201cWhat is the best position for a new billboard?\u201d and \u201cWhich hotel room has the best view?\u201d in the presence of obstacles. These applications require measuring and differentiating the visibility of an object (target) from different viewpoints in a dataspace, e.g., a billboard may be seen from many points but is readable only from a few points closer to it. In this paper, we formulate the above problem of quantifying the visibility of (from) a target object from (of) the surrounding area with a visibility color map (VCM). A VCM is essentially defined as a surface color map of the space, where each viewpoint of the space is assigned a color value that denotes the visibility measure of the target from that viewpoint. Measuring the visibility of a target even from a single viewpoint is an expensive operation, as we need to consider factors such as distance, angle, and obstacles between the viewpoint and the target. Hence, a straightforward approach to construct the VCM that requires visibility computation for every viewpoint of the surrounding space of the target is prohibitively expensive in terms of both I/Os and computation, especially for a real dataset comprising thousands of obstacles. We propose an efficient approach to compute the VCM based on a key property of the human vision that eliminates the necessity for computing the visibility for a large number of viewpoints of the space. To further reduce the computational overhead, we propose two approximations; namely, minimum bounding rectangle and tangential approaches with guaranteed error bounds. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our solutions to construct the VCM for real 2D and 3D datasets.",

        "Abstract": "Audio-based virtual environments have been increasingly used to foster cognitive and learning skills. A number of studies have also highlighted that the use of technology can help learners to develop effective skills such as motivation and self-esteem. This study presents the design and usability of 3D interactive environments for children with visual disabilities to help them solve problems in Chilean geography and culture. We introduce AudioChile, a virtual environment that can be navigated through 3D sound to enhance spatiality and immersion throughout the environment. 3D sound is used to orientate, avoid obstacles, and identify the positions of various characters and objects within the environment. We have found during the usability evaluation that sound can be fundamental for attention and motivation purposes during interaction. Learners identified and clearly discriminated environmental sounds to solve everyday problems, spatial orientation, and laterality.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Past research has revealed that insufficient pain assessment could, and often, has negative implications on the provision of quality health care. While current available clinical approaches have proven to be valid interventions, they are expensive and can often fail in providing efficient pain measurements. The increase in the prevalence of pain calls for more intuitive pain assessment solutions. Computerized alternatives have already been proposed both in the literature and in commerce, but may lack essential qualities such as accuracy of the collected clinical information and effective patient-clinician interaction. In response to this concern, 3-dimensional (3D) technology could become the innovative intervention needed to support and improve the pain assessment process. Objective: The purpose of this analysis was to describe qualitative findings from a study which was designed to explore patients' perceptions of adopting 3D technology in the assessment of their pain experience related to important themes that might positively or negatively influence the quality of the pain assessment process. Methods: The perceptions of 60 individuals with some form of pain in the area of Greater London were collected through semi-structured interviews. Of the 60 respondents, 24 (43%) produced usable responses and were analyzed for content using principles of the grounded theory approach and thematic analysis, in order to gain insight into the participants' beliefs and attitudes towards adopting 3D technology in pain assessment. Results: The analysis identified 4 high-level core themes that were representative of the participants' responses. These themes indicated that most respondents valued \"the potential of 3D technology to facilitate better assessment of pain\" as the most useful outcome of adopting a 3D approach. Respondents also expressed their opinions on the usability of the 3D approach, with no important concerns reported about its perceived ease of use. Our findings finally, showed that respondents appreciated the perceived clinical utility of the proposed approach, which could further have an influence on their intention to use it. Conclusions: These findings highlighted factors that are seen as essential for improving the assessment of pain, and demonstrated the need for a strong focus on patient-clinician communication. The participants of this analysis believed that the introduction of 3D technology in the process might be a useful mechanism for such a positive health care outcome. The study's findings could also be used to make recommendations concerning the potential for inclusion of 3D technology in current clinical pain tools for the purpose of improving the quality of health care.
